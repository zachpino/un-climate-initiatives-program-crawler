New York, NY 10018","100 Resilient Cities—Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation is financially supported by The Rockefeller Foundation and managed as a sponsored project by Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors (RPA), an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that provides governance and operational infrastructure to its sponsored projects.
In April 2019 the news broke that 100 Resilient Cities was to no longer receive funding from the Rockefeller Foundation six years after its launch.
The announcement came as a major shock to its almost 100 staff and those familiar with its work, as the organisation had by all measures been successful in its primary aim—helping cities build workable resiliency strategies.
Budget issues and a change in leadership at the foundation in 2017 were the most likely reasons for 100RC’s sudden exit, but a glimmer of hope emerged when the foundation agreed to continue funding some of its initiatives, like the chief resilience officer (CRO) roles it had helped create in cities.
Six months on we are beginning to see what the transition looks like with the creation of two new organisations, Resilient Cities Catalyst (RCC), which was unveiled last week, and the Global Resilient Cities Network (GRCN), which will be officially launched at the World Urban Forum next week.",Global,Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors,NGO/Civil Society,United States of America,"100 Resilient Cities—Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation (100RC) is dedicated to helping cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century.
100RC supports the adoption and incorporation of a view of resilience that includes not just the shocks—earthquakes, fires, floods, etc.—but also the stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a day to day or cyclical basis.
Examples of these stresses include high unemployment; an overtaxed or inefficient public transportation system; endemic violence; or chronic food and water shortages. By addressing both the shocks and the stresses, a city becomes more able to respond to adverse events, and is overall better able to deliver basic functions in both good times and bad, to all populations.","100RC aims not only to help individual cities become more resilient, but will facilitate the building of a global practice of resilience among governments, NGOs, the private sector, and individual citizens.","Cities in the 100RC network are provided with the resources necessary to develop a roadmap to resilience along four main pathways:
Financial and logistical guidance for establishing an innovative new position in city government, a Chief Resilience Officer, who will lead the city’s resilience efforts; Expert support for development of a robust resilience strategy; Access to solutions, service providers, and partners from the private, public and NGO sectors who can help them develop and implement their resilience strategies; and Membership of a global network of member cities who can learn from and help each other.",,"Technical dialogue,  Capacity building","Knowledge production and innovation,  Training and education",,,,,,,,"A survey by 100 Resilient Cities, a network of conurbations, found that climate change is

Climate finance allocations were integrated within IFAD’s country based allocations (loans and grants). Projects were submitted to IFAD's Executive Board for approval and supervision and implementation support to projects is provided in line with established IFAD procedures.
https://www.ifad.org/topic/asap/overview
During the first phase of ASAP, from 2012 to 2017, IFAD programmed US$305 million in ASAP grants in 41 countries, expecting to reach more than 5 million vulnerable smallholders to cope with the impacts of climate change and build more resilient livelihoods. ASAP has substantively enhanced climate risk mainstreaming in IFAD’s investment processes, and promoted innovative tools and technologies that smallholders are using to protect their assets from greater climate variability.
ASAP2 has been generously financed by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), which has agreed to contribute NOK80 million – equivalent to about US $9.5 million – to the ASAP Trust Fund, and the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), with a contribution of SEK60million – equivalent to US $5.9 million.
The ASAP2 instrument will enable climate mainstreaming through technical assistance and capacity building in cooperation with national ministries, research institutes, farmers’ organizations and civil society, and leverage IFAD investments to incentivize additional co-financing for climate change adaptation.
The Contribution Agreements of both Nordic nations follows from their strong support during the first phase of ASAP. The renewed commitments will go toward addressing the additional costs of climate change in IFAD’s investment programmes, and contribute to specific elements of the Sustainable Development Goals, as set out in the results framework of the agreements. IFAD values the confidence that Norway and Sweden have shown in the Fund’s ability to carry out operations on behalf of smallholder farmers.
The overall target for the ASAP2 Trust Fund is US$100 million.",Global,"International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),",International organisation,Italy,"The Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP) channels climate finance to smallholder farmers so they can access the information, tools and technologies that will help build their resilience to climate change. Launched by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in 2012, ASAP has become the largest global financing source dedicated to supporting the adaptation of poor smallholder farmers to climate change, with committed funding of US$316.2 million. Since inception of the programme in September 2012, 42 ASAP-supported projects were approved by the IFAD Executive Board, committing an amount of US$292.6 million from the ASAP trust fund to concrete actions that help smallholder farmers adapt to the impacts of climate change.
World's largest climate change adaptation programme focused on smallholder farmers;
As of August 2018, all 42 projects have signed government agreements;
37 approved projects have started disbursement, totalling US$80 million;
US$292.6 million channelled to at least eight million smallholder farmers to build their resilience to climate-related shocks and stresses;
Financed by IFAD and the governments of Belgium, Canada, Finland, the Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the Region of Flanders.","The objective of ASAP is to improve the climate resilience of large-scale rural development programmes and improve the capacity of at least 8 million smallholder farmers to expand their options in a rapidly changing environment. Through ASAP, IFAD will drive a major scaling-up of successful “multiple-benefit” approaches which can increase agricultural output while at the same time reducing and diversifying climate-related risks.
This is done through:
policy engagement –supporting agricultural institutions in IFAD Member States seeking to achieve international climate change commitments and national adaptation priorities;
climate risk assessment – facilitating the systematic use of climate risk information when planning investments to increase resilience;
women’s empowerment – increasing the participation of women in, and their benefits from, climate-change adaptation activities;
private-sector engagement – strengthening the participation of the private sector and farmer groups in climate change adaptation and mitigation activities;
climate services – enhancing the use of climate information for when planning investments to increase resilience;
natural resource management and governance – strengthening the participation and ownership of smallholder farmers in decision-making processes; and improving technologies for the governance and management of climate-sensitive natural resources;
knowledge management – enhancing the documentation and dissemination of knowledge on approaches to climate-resilient agriculture.","Mixed crop and livestock systems which integrate the use of drought-tolerant crops and manure, which can help increase agricultural productivity whilst at the same time diversifying risks across different products.
Systems of crop rotation which consider both food and fodder crops, which can reduce exposure to climate threats while also improving family nutrition.
A combination of agroforestry systems and communal ponds, which can improve the quality of soils, increase the availability of water during dry periods, and provide additional income.
Back to back with these multiple-benefit approaches, ASAP will empower community-based organizations to make use of new climate risk management skills, information and technologies. These can include improved weather stations networks, which can provide farmers with more reliable seasonal forecasts and cropping calendars; Geographic Information Systems, which can help farmers better understand and monitor landscape use in a changing environment; and economic valuation of climate change impacts which can help inform more robust policy decisions.
By blending tried and tested 'no regrets' approaches to rural development with modern adaptation know-how, ASAP is well positioned to increase the climate resilience of IFAD's approximately US$ 1billion per year of new investments. In doing so, ASAP embodies one of the most concrete and decisive steps a UN agency has ever undertaken to truly integrate climate change into its programming.","Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP) brochure https://www.ifad.org/web/knowledge/publication/asset/39186467

WACA boosts the transfer of knowledge, foster political dialogue among countries, and mobilize public and private finance to tackle coastal erosion, flooding, pollution and climate change adaptation.","The objective is to strengthen the resilience of targeted communities and areas in coastal Western Africa.
In that respect, WACA aims to enhance the absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities of the beneficiary countries and to reduce the shared risks to which they are exposed, either natural or man-made, and that are similar for all or most countries or transboundary in nature.","Interventions include:
1) WACA national Resilience Investment projects: These include each regional integration and support activities (WAEMU, IUCN, Centre de Suivi Ecologique, Abidjan Convention), strengthening of national policy and institutions, and strengthening national physical and social investments.
2) WACA Regional Scale-Up Platform: 
- On knowledge, WACA engages international expertise hubs, the African Center of Excellence for Coastal Resilience, the West Africa Coastal Observatory, “Call for Innovations”, and knowledge exchanges between countries and people.
- On finance, the WACA Marketplace is in place as a simplified investment mechanism that aims to match the demand for coastal resilience investments with the supply of partner financing. WACA is engaging the private sector to help develop the relationships, tools and mechanisms needed to support their engagement in strengthened coastal resilience for the region.
- On Dialogue, the 2018 WACA Country Communique provided the authorizing environment to pursue the three critical streams of work for WACA. First, regional integration by working via regional economic commissions (WAEMU and ECOWAS, the Abidjan Convention and its protocols, and the pursuit of a regional observatory for coastal resilience continuing the work by the Centre de Suivi Ecologique. Second, national scale-up through expanding on the WACA Multi-Sector Investment Plans. Third, mobilizing financial resources from partners in support of new WACA projects or in complement to existing WACA projects for strengthened coastal resilience. In addition, the WACA Local Action and Citizen Engagement (LACE) is about supporting a pro-poor, people-centered approach to promoting sustainable, inclusive and resilient development in the West African coast. Finally, the WACA Forum brings it all together and is at the center of the dialogue and engagement. It ensures inclusiveness and transparency and is convened once a year, hosted by one of the WACA countries. The Forum provides a space for a joint discussion of topics pertaining to knowledge and finance, and takes up special themes (e.g., ports or coastal observation) as they relate to coastal resilience to explore and address bottlenecks or opportunities for that specific theme.","Total mobilized financing resources: World Bank $190 million, Global Environment Facility $25 million, Nordic Development Fund $18 milion, in additional to several Bank-executes trust funds sposored by Japan, Korea, Norway and France.

African Adaptation Initiative (AAI),No,Yes,https://africaadaptationinitiative.org/,,2015,,"Contact: info@africaadaptationinitiative.org
The 26th session of the African Union, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in January 2016, established a Technical Working Group (TWG) to oversee the operationalisation of the AAI (AU Decision 603). The TWG Is Chaired by AMCEN and includes representatives of the AGN, the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the African Union Commission (AUC), New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) as well as other institutions and organisations as appropriate, such as the Africa Risk Capacity (ARC). The TWG will guide the AAI through the conceptual phase to operationalisation.","The AAI is an African-led initiative which is strongly rooted in existing African institutions.
Political guidance: Political leadership to guide AAI is provided by the Conference of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC) and the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN).
Steering Committee: AAI’s steering committee comprises the AMCEN Bureau and Chair of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN).
Technical Support Unit: The day-to-day operations of the AAI is coordinated by the AAI’s Technical Support Unit (TSU).",Africa,African Adaptation Initiative (AAI),Other intergovernmental organization,Ethiopia,"In launching the AAI, African Heads of State have initiated high-level pan-African and regional dialogues, adaptation action on the ground, and cross-sector processes to strengthen collaboration on adaptation across Africa. The AAI will: (i) Raise awareness of climate adaptation; (ii) Facilitate knowledge management, capacity building and capacity strengthening; (iii) Support and facilitate resource mobilization for implementation; (iv) Promote co-operation and partnerships (at sub-regional and regional levels) for synergy, scale and maximize shared benefits; (v) Track progress through monitoring and evaluation of action.
The AAI represents a bold and innovative step by Africa to galvanize the support needed to significantly scale up adaptation on the continent. The AAI is an initiative for Africa, and it is driven and coordinated by Africa. It is rooted in a mandate provided to the African Ministerial Conference on Environment (AMCEN) by the 25th African Union Summit held in Johannesburg, South Africa in June 2015. At the 2015 AU Summit, AMCEN was directed to develop, with the African Group of Negotiators (AGN), a proposal for enhanced support to Africa on adaptation. The AAI was developed and launched later that year, in December 2015. Initially focussed on enhancing action in the pre-2020 period, the work plan is now focussed on achieving results for adaptation in Africa post-2020.","The AAI aims to enhance action on adaptation, with the aim of addressing the adaptation financing gap, and implementing measures to address disaster risk reduction and resilience needs in Africa.
The AAI takes a strategic view of adaptation across Africa – identifying the gaps and connecting regional partners to find solutions. 
Through partnerships with institutions undertaking relevant work on the continent, the AAI is scaling-up and replicating successful ongoing initiatives and developing proposals for new initiatives. This begins by coordinating with partners to support four AAI Flagship Programmes: 1) Climate Information Services; 2) Advancing Risk Transfer in Africa; 3) Lake Chad River Basin Early Warning System and; 4) Knowledge Management Programme for Adaptation Planning in Africa. Two additional Flagship initiatives are in the pipeline.
AAI carries out this unified approach to adaptation in Africa by coordinating action across four areas of focus, known as AAI’s ‘Pillars’.","After successfully delivering results as intended under Phase 1 (2015-2016) and Phase 2 (2017-19), the AAI is now resourcing and implementing post-2020 activities under Phase 3 (2020-2030).
Phase 3 begins with achieving transformative results for adaptation in Africa through a 2020-2025 Roadmap. In delivering the AAI 2020-2025 Roadmap, the AAI seeks to contribute results across four high-level outcome areas:
1) USD 1 Billion is invested in African countries by 2025 to ensure adequate climate information services (including early-warning systems and observational infrastructure) to support robust policy and decision-making on adaptation;
2) All African countries have translated their National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and their NDC Adaptation into investment plans, and fundable pipeline of projects by 2025;
3) Doubling of adaptation finance accessed and mobilized by African countries by 2025 for their urgent priorities;
4) Implementation of at least one regional flagship programme in each of the 5 regions in Africa, addressing the critical sectors (and drivers) of the African economy: agriculture, water, disaster reduction, cities and local communities, coastal protection, health and biodiversity and ecosystems.",,,,,"1) All African countries have climate information services adequate in quantity and quality to support decision making.
2) Stronger continental, regional, and national institutional and policy frameworks to support decision making on adaptation and loss and damage in Africa.
3) Significantly increase the number of projects and programs being
implemented to enhance adaptation and address loss and damage in Africa.
4) Increase access to funding and mobilise additional support to enable the implementation of adaptation actions and approaches to address loss and damage.",,,,,,https://www.africaadaptationinitiative.org/assets/aai_brochure_en_2016.pdf,,No,No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, Yes, No, Yes, No, No, No

Airports can participate at one of four progressively stringent levels of accreditation: 1. Mapping; 2. Reduction; 3. Optimisation; and 4. Transformation. In addition, airports at Level 3 and 4 can choose to offset their residual emissions, thereby achieving Level 3+ (Neutrality) and 4+ (Transition) respectively.

In 2020, Level 4 (Transformation) and 4+ (Transition) have been added to the Airport Carbon Accreditation programme to align it with the objectives of the Paris Agreement to limit the increase of global average temperature to 2°C above pre-industrial levels and aim to not exceed 1.5°C. Levels 4 and 4+ have been introduced as an interim step towards the long-term goal of supporting airports in achieving net zero carbon emissions. Level 4 and 4+ will therefore encourage airports to reduce their emissions in line with the latest scientific and political developments and meet growing public and stakeholder expectations.","Member airports are committed to reduce carbon emissions from their operations, with the ultimate goal of becoming carbon neutral.

It is presently composed of about 100 manufacturers and businesses which rely on HCFCs, and HFCs.  The Alliance represent more than 95 percent of US HFC production and a significant majority of the manufacturing and other user industries. The Alliance is lead by an Allance Board and the Alliance Staff.",North America,,Business,United States of America,"The Alliance is a leading industry voice that coordinates industry participation in the development of International and U.S. government policies regarding ozone protection and climate change. The Alliance is now primarily concerned with developing an orderly transition away from the use of HCFCs and HFCs in a managed process which allows its members to move towards alternative substances while continuing to meet the public’s increasing demand for safe, efficient products such as refrigeration, heat pumps, fire safety systems and medical devices as living standards and societal needs increase across the world.","Its overarching goal has been to encourage responsible, reasonable, and cost-effective ozone protection and climate change policies to be determined at the international level and to oppose the development of a patchwork of different policies at the lower levels of government. In 2014, the Aliance made its pledge to support policies and actions with a goal to reduce global hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions by 80 percent by 2050.","Adapting to growing global concerns regarding the climate change impact of HFCs, the Alliance became involved in early negotiations that led to the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. The continuous engagement in Montreal Protocol and UNFCCC-related negotiations and policymaking related to HFCs has been important because HFCs are connected to both the transition away from ozone-depleting substances and the contribution to climate change. The alliance is also involved in the development of industry-led initiatives launched in 2014 to address the climate impact of equipment in the food cold chain as well as emissions from equipment servicing and end-of-life disposal. At today’s event, the Alliance announced a new Memorandum of Understanding with industry partners to develop and implement the first ever Reclaimed HFC Credit Bank. This program seeks to create a market mechanism to increase the use of reclaimed HFCs and is supportive of the Alliance’s 2014 petition for EPA to extend Section 608 of the Clean Air Act to HFCs.

 A below50 policy document was communicated by companies to policy makers on a united view on the European Renewable Energy Directive (REDII). The document included a call for REDII to be focused on not only second generation biofuels. It acknowledged the important role that conventional biofuels, with high GHG reduction potential, can play in meeting decarbonization and renewables targets for the transport sector.
 Introducing regional below50 hubs and diversifying the membership structure has allowed below50 to better reflect its marketplace. This in turn has led to a significant uptake in engagement with a 60% increase in membership. below50 has also attracted an official partnership with the We Mean Business coalition to further expand the reach and uptake of below50’s work on low carbon fuels. • The aim beyond 2017 is to expand the number of regional hubs to directly address the barriers in additional markets. Countries of immediate interest include China and the Philippines.
Capacity building:

 In July 2017, below50 partnered with BIO to organize a below50 event at BIO World Congress on Industrial Biotechnology (#BIOWC17) in Montreal. Industry leaders, government officials and academic researchers met to share the latest advances across the spectrum of industrial biotechnology including renewable chemicals, synthetic biology, food ingredients and advanced biofuels.

The ISFL will pilot programs and interventions at a jurisdictional scale in order to test approaches and share lessons learned broadly.

The BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable Forest Landscapes was established in 2013. The Initiative is supported by Germany, the Kingdom of Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), and the United States. It has $355 million in fund capital and supports programs in Colombia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Mexico, and Zambia.","The ISFL aims to catalyze the development of a low-carbon rural economy in each of its program areas that will simultaneously result in livelihood opportunities for communities and an overall reduction in emissions from the land.

The ISFL will achieve its objective of greenhouse gas emission reductions, while also addressing poverty and unsustainable land use, through four key design elements.
Working at Scale
Each ISFL program focuses on an entire jurisdiction (state, province, or region) within a country, which provides programs with the opportunity to engage with multiple sectors affecting land use and increase its impact over a relatively large area. The ISFL utilizes a landscape approach in each jurisdiction, which requires stakeholders to consider the trade-offs and synergies between different sectors that may compete in a jurisdiction for land use – such as forests, agriculture, energy, mining, and infrastructure. In doing so, solutions can be identified to serve multiple objectives and influence a variety of sectors.
The goal of the landscape approach is to implement a development strategy that strives for environmental, social, and economic impact at scale. This is done by targeting interventions to improve the enabling environment for sustainable land use. Improvements in the enabling environment such as participatory forest management or land use planning can have significant impact on how land is used and can benefit communities across a jurisdiction.
Leveraging Partnerships
In order to reduce GHG emissions from land use across an entire jurisdiction while simultaneously creating livelihood opportunities, the ISFL will create partnerships with other public sector initiatives and private sector actors. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are essential to mobilize capital and align objectives in order to create sustainable and scalable models for long-term improved land use.
Private actors – from subsistence farmers to global multi-national firms – have significant influence on the way land is used. The ISFL intends to engage these actors through its programs and, more broadly, work alongside global forums of companies that have pledged to reduce their impact on tropical forests to help identify pathways to enact these commitments. The ISFL will explore opportunities to engage the private sector in the agriculture, energy, and finance sectors, amongst others, where that sector has a significant impact on landscapes within a jurisdiction.
Engagements with the private sector can take several forms, from collaborating on sustainability approaches, to blending finance in-country, to convening stakeholders to work toward complementary goals. Through these partnerships, the ISFL can impact the private sector’s contribution to sustainable land use and increased productivity, ultimately reducing GHG emissions and generating livelihood opportunities.
The public sector has an essential role to play in shaping private sector behavior through appropriate policy setting, regulation and promoting sustainability in a variety of sectors. By addressing these issues, countries can ultimately reduce risk and drive private sector investments in a green economy that benefits people and the environment.
Incentivizing Results
By taking on the immense challenges of convening public and private actors and creating an enabling environment for sustainable development, countries can expect to generate results – including a reduction in GHG emissions. To incentivize countries to do so, the ISFL will provide significant results-based climate finance over a 10-15 year period by purchasing verified emission reductions.
This results-based finance is intended to create a positive feedback loop for successful interventions for sustainable land use in each program country. If effective, each jurisdiction can continue to generate results, sell verified emission reductions, and reinvest in successful interventions. Eventually, this model for sustainable development could be scaled up beyond each jurisdiction.
Building on Experience
The ISFL reflects the demand for progression from relatively small-scale pilot projects to a program aimed at incentivizing sustainable land use at scale. To work at scale effectively, the ISFL builds on the experiences and lessons learned by the BioCarbon Fund’s initial work piloting land use projects, REDD+ initiatives, and other sustainable forest and land use programs.
More specifically, the ISFL relies on the national REDD+ readiness work of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) and the United Nations REDD Programme (UN-REDD), which have created essential institutional infrastructure for large-scale land use programs, including:

 An emphasis on accountable and transparent program management arrangements
 Clear operating mandates
 Multi-sector coordination mechanisms and cross-sector collaboration
 Technical supervision capacity
 Funds management capacity
 Mechanisms for feedback and grievance redress
This streamlined approach allows the ISFL to concentrate its efforts and activities at the jurisdictional level, adding value to existing platforms, while not duplicating existing processes. By building on this experience, the ISFL can, to some extent, limit the administrative burden of implementing jurisdictional programs and focus implementation efforts at the program-level by tapping into functional coordination platforms.
The ISFL will seek to engage relevant stakeholders in program countries, taking into consideration the existing mechanisms in the country, including the FCPF, UN-REDD, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as well as agriculture, energy, infrastructure, and other relevant stakeholder groups working in each landscape. Priority will be given to already organized groups of stakeholders and other initiatives such as broader national climate change platforms. In cases where other land-use based projects supported by the World Bank Group and other partners are established, the ISFL program will identify them for effective engagement including building on their structures of engagement, as appropriate.","ISFL Funding Instruments

In order to achieve success in each ISFL program, countries will require several tools and approaches at their disposal, and the flexibility to combine them to suit the country’s context. The design of the BioCFplus, a true pioneer for the World Bank Group and carbon and land use funds - in combination with the results-based finance from BioCF Tranche 3 (T3) - can provide this flexibility.
BioCFplus:

 Provides funding in the form of a grant. 134.7 M$ pledged (2022)
 Supports countries to make improvements to its enabling environment for sustainable land use.
 Supports piloting of activities and key partnerships, including engagements with private sector.
 Provides resources to countries to develop systems for monitoring, reporting, and verifying reductions in GHG emissions to prepare jurisdictions for payments.

BioCF Tranche 3:

 Provides results-based finance through the purchase of verified emissions reductions. 232.6 M$ pledged (2022)
 Payments provide incentives for countries to shift to a sustainable development trajectory for each jurisdiction.
 Payments can be used to sustain successful interventions to sustainable land use in each jurisdiction.

The BioCFplus has been designed specifically to operationalize the vision of the ISFL, which requires several innovative elements in order to meet the demand on the ground in ISFL countries. The fund supports technical assistance and capacity building efforts in each jurisdiction and can provide some critical investment finance to test sustainable land use approaches. This combination of finance from one source gives flexibility to countries to design their programs in an integrated way and identify the most effective approaches for land management.
In addition, the BioCF plus can directly finance advisory service projects through the International Finance Corporation (IFC). This direct funding link with the IFC is groundbreaking for the World Bank Group and aligns goals and visions more closely. IFC advisory service projects can attract private sector interest in ISFL jurisdictions and can benefit farmers and other private sector actors directly.
Meanwhile, the BioCF T3 provides payments for verified emission reductions generated across the landscape, which are expected to yield significant revenue over a 10-15 year period. These payments are envisioned to sustain and build on interventions successfully implemented in the jurisdiction and beyond. It is the ambition of the ISFL to generate a feedback loop of funding for sustainable land use.",,"Funding,  Implementation,  Technical dialogue","Fundraising,  Technical operational implementation (ex-post),  Knowledge dissemination and exchange,  Knowledge production and innovation,  Financing",,"The ISFL aims to catalyze the development of a low-carbon rural economy in each of its program areas that will simultaneously result in livelihood opportunities for communities and an overall reduction in emissions from the land.

By signing up, companies commit to align their actions with three core elements:
•Set an internal carbon price high enough to materially affect investment decisions to drive down greenhouse gas emissions;
•Publicly advocate the importance of carbon pricing through policy mechanisms that take into account country specific economies and policy contexts; and

•	Encourage governments to develop policies that can lead to a meaningful price of carbon on the market.
Aligned with the below 2-degree Celsius pathway, the initiative asks companies to: 
(1) Set an internal carbon price high enough to materially affect investment decisions to drive down greenhouse gas emissions; 
(2) Publicly advocate the importance of carbon pricing through policy mechanisms that take into account country specific economies and policy contexts; and 
(3) Communicate on progress over time on the two criteria above in public corporate reports.

Furthermore, the European Commission announced the OGMP as the basis for improvements in its MRV, including considering the OGMP framework as the basis for upcoming legislative proposals.","Ten companies are engaged in the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership representing more than 15% of the world market, with a total of 25,000 tons of methane emissions avoided over three years and over 1,260 technological changes reported by partner companies. The OGMP and CCAC's overall efforts to engage with the oil and gas sector greatly contributed to raise awareness on the issue among governments and companies. As a result, the methane landscape has changed. Through CCAC, a growing number of international oil and gas companies are taking initial voluntary steps to integrate methane management in their current and future operations and engaging their partners to raise awareness of the methane issue across the entire gas supply chain. Industry has also created its own platforms, such as the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), and the Methane Guiding Principles (MGP). Mexico, Canada and the US have already regulated these emissions and awareness about the benefits of reducing methane emissions grew among policy makers and the general public.","Technical dialogue,  Implementation","Technical operational implementation (ex-post),  Knowledge production and innovation","Technical operational implementation (ex-post) — Total MitigationYear2018Value (MtCO2e/yr)0,4","Long-term objective: Significantly increase the number of oil & gas companies participating in the OGMP and following its protocols, and by so doing significantly reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector – one of the largest man-made source of methane emissions.
While participating companies are expected to eventually include all of their operated assets under the protocols of the OGMP, there is no minimum number or share of assets that a company must start with or maintain, and companies add new assets at their own pace. However, the requirement for companies to report annually the share of their assets participating gives them an incentive to add new assets at a reasonable pace. Companies help recruit other companies by emphasizing the advantages of collaboration on this issue, with opportunities to learn from each other.","Partner companies started implementing some of the reduction opportunities identified during surveys of their operations, resulting in emissions reductions of 25,000 tons of methane",,,"The OGMP companies reports are yearly submitted in  Spring and the OGMP annual reports are released in Autumn.

Knowledge: Developed a non-competitive platform for common research on new low carbon cements, and to involve downstream users. Knowledge products: 10 Technical Guidance documents to address 'core' methane emissions sources. Partner companies have begun implementing identified methane reduction opportunities, resulting in some 25,000 tons of methane emissions avoided as of 2017. Each company covers the cost of its own participation, including investments it makes in mitigation projects, but the cost of such investments is not part of the company reporting. In addition, the dialogue created by the OGMP among the companies, NGOs and governments led to the recognition of the need for more data on methane emissions, which resulted in the creation of the Methane Science Studies of the CCAC.","The Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) Secretariat has a Mineral Methane Initiative (formerly Oil and Gas Initiative) which serves as a Secretariat for the coordination, monitoring and administration of the OGMP.

More specifically, it aims to mobilize efforts of the private sector, civil society, international organizations, and governments","HFC Inventories: HFCs have a wide range of uses, including in foams, refrigeration, and aerosols, and manufacturers tend to use well-known existing technology solutions that currently are not as climate-friendly as they could be. This activity provides insights on sector-by-sector use patterns and opportunities to avoid HFC growth in countries. In order to increase understanding of the use and potential growth of HFCs, the initiative has produced 14 HFC consumption inventories in developing countries. These surveys are critical to help countries identify national HFC consumption and sectors most exposed in order to healp prioitize where they can best start implementing the Kigali Amendment.
Technology Demonstration Projects
These demonstration projects, approved by the Coalition's Working Group in April 2014, will demonstrate and promote the deployment of low-global warming potential (GWP), climate-friendly alternatives in key sectors, including commercial refrigeration and motor vehicle air conditioning, wherein high-GWP hudrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are already widely used and expected to grow substantially over the next few decades. The demonstrations being carried out are intended to show the technical feasibility and commercial viability of low-GWP, energy efficient technologies, which could then lead to the broader uptake/replication of the technologies concerned across the sector or geographic area.
Capacity Building: This workstream aims to build capacity amongst industry stakeholders and policy-makers on HFC alternative technologies, policies and standards, addressing specific sectors where HFCs are used. When these activities started in 2012, the CCAC was currently the only forum where these types of efforts on HFCs were taking place in a coordinated and strategic manner. Since 2012, the CCAC has organized a total of 6 major international conferences on alternative technologies. In addition, the CCAC has also produced various case studies, information materials and tools, and organized several thematic events and workshops.","On October 15, 2016, the world reached an agreement to phase-down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). It is one of the most significant actions governments have ever taken to protect the climate. HFCs are highly potent greenhouse gases that have a global warming potential 1000’s of times that of carbon dioxide (CO2).
The Kigali Amendment represents a historic step in combatting climate change. Since 2012, Coalition partners which includes the private sector, have worked to support the HFC Amendment under the Montreal Protocol by promoting HFC alternative technologies through case studies and international conferences, supporting the development of HFC inventories and studies, conducting demonstration projects to validate climate-friendly alternatives and technologies, and building political support. Moreover, both state and non-state partners have invested huge efforts beyond the initiative projects to support the negotiations process. For example, the industry partners of the CCAC have co-financed technology and policy conferences on HFC alternatives since 2012, and have stressed over and over their support and readiness to phasedown high-GWP HFCs.","Political dialogue,  Technical dialogue,  Implementation","Policy planning and recommendations,  Advocacy,  Knowledge production and innovation,  Goal setting (ex-ante)",Goal setting (ex-ante) — Total MitigationYear2030Value (MtCO2e/yr)3800,The HFC Initiative's overall objective is to significantly reduce the projected growth in the use and emissions of high-GWP HFCs in coming decades,,Goals are achieved through a set of activities that are implemented by partners and monitored by the CCAC Secretariat/UN Environment.

Among the cities that have received technical assistance are Penang State, Malaysia; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Rayong, Thailand; Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; Cebu City, Philippines; Map Ta Phut, Thailand; Panvel, India.
To provide locally appropriate capacity training and support, the Initiative recreated seven regional city networks. These networks were for the regions of Latin America and Mexico, Central America, Francophone Africa, South East Asia, South East Europe, Sub-Saharan and East Africa, and India. 
Likewise multiple cities have been supported to take part in city exchanges. 13 city exchanges have been conducted. The city exchanges pair mentor cities in the city network with mentee cities. During the exchanges, the mentor city hosts the mentee cities to present their current waste management system and how they got there. In turn, the mentor city might choose to visit a mentee city to provide guidance on how to improve their waste management.

Decision-making on routine matters of day-to-day coordination and the mechanics of coordinating periodic meetings convened by the Alliance will be handled by the Secretariat. The Secretariat is also responsible for organising an annual members assembly and for leading Alliance Fundraising efforts. The Secretariat is hosted by the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI).

The Members are actively involved in the activities of the Alliance through participation and contribution to the achievement of the Alliance’s strategy and outputs, such as building a stronger global architecture, identifying solutions and gaps, supporting faster deployment of existing investment solutions and development of new instruments, and/or building awareness and ambition. They should agree to be listed as a member of the Alliance in public documents, presentations and electronic media (i.e. website).
The Steering Committee is responsible for making strategic decisions on items put forward by the Secretariat, reviewing and agreeing on a 2-year strategy along with work plans and budget requests from the Action Groups. The Steering Committee provides operational and financial oversight of and political guidance to the Secretariat. It engages external relations activities for the Alliance and promotes its work. It works closely with the Secretariat to mobilize financial resources to support the work of the Alliance. The Steering Committee includes fourteen seats, including two from each of the seven constituency groups represented in the Alliance.  
The Action Groups (AGs) lead substantive efforts of the Alliance. The groups are a set of Alliance members that work together to achieve pre-agreed goals in a specified timeframe in the city-level climate-related finance area.   The AGs  will be convened, covering work areas and tasks that are agreed in the Working Plan of each group. Each Action Group will be led by chair/co-chair, supported by the Secretariat.",Global,Climate Policy Initiative (CPI),Academic/Research institution,United Kingdom,"The Cities Climate Finance Leadership Alliance (the Alliance) is a multi-level and multi-stakeholder coalition aimed at closing the investment gap for urban subnational climate projects and infrastructure. The Alliance provides a platform to convene and exchange knowledge among all relevant actors dedicated to urban development, climate action, and/or financing.
Alliance members include public and private financial institutions, governments, international organizations, NGOs, research groups, and networks that represent most of the world’s largest cities. As such, its members also represent the main market players in city-level climate finance.",The objective of the Cities Climate Finance Leadership Alliance is to mobilize finance for city-level climate action at scale by 2030 mainly through amplifying ambition and engagement for city-level finance and by bridging the demand and supply along the investment chain for city-level climate-related finance.,"Facilitating Investment through Action Learning and Analysis :
The Alliance aims to facilitate investment through four main thematic Action Groups: a. Project preparation; b. Financial toolbox; c. Enabling frameworks; d. Global architecture. The Alliance will be publishing a renewed version of the State of Cities Climate Finance Report to track current levels of investment in low-emission, climate resilient urban infrastructure and gather best practices and commitments from Alliance members. It will also provide analytical briefs and research pieces on various topics to identify gaps and/or solutions to gaps in city-level climate-related finance. It will be establishing linkages with other global initiatives like the Gap Fund, Leadership for Urban Climate Investments (LUCI).
Sharing knowledge, resources, and actions through an online hub:
The Alliance plans to build a knowledge hub, an organized repository of knowledge. It will serve the multiple stakeholders in the sub-national climate finance domain especially the local governments and city networks with low capacity for identifying existing solutions and gaps in city-level climate-related finance. It will aim to avoid duplication of efforts and repetition of the same mistakes due to lack of knowledge of best practices. It will be a curated repository of financial tools (e.g., open access financial models), templates (e.g., financial instrument blueprints, project preparation requirements), helpful for cities to access climate finance. 
Elevating commitments and amplifying actions to scale: 
The Alliance will organise an Annual Alliance Assembly with all members typically organized in the margins of a large conference. It will actively participate in other global events on sub-national climate finance. It will organise local and regional practitioner forums with the Project Preparation Action Group. The Secretariat also has plans to announce the Annual Alliance Scale Impact Prize to recognize and elevate best practices/ projects/ initiatives of Alliance members.
""Advocacy - Members harness advocacy synergies, with the ultimate goal to catalyze climate aligned capital flows for climate-smart infrastructure investments at the local level. The Alliance calls for and facilitates action and innovation by advocating opportunities to tackle gaps and needs addressing key actors, such as governments and financial institutions, amongst others.
Knowledge - Members use the Alliance to create, gather, and share knowledge an information - including good practice, guidance and tools - from all over the world, making it widely accessible. Members work collaboratively to produce new knowledge products that fill in existing gaps that are identified together. 
Cooperation - Members co-design approaches to pilot, replicate, and mainstream solutions for scaling up climate finance in cities.""","The first “State of City Climate Finance” report was launched in 2015 by the Cities Climate Finance Leadership Alliance. The report identifies the gap between the current levels of investment in low-emission, climate-resilient urban infrastructure and the volumes required to ensure that the world is on track to keep global temperature rise below 2 degrees. The report also includes analysis of major barriers to investment and solutions to address these. The report suggests that national governments adopt policies and incentives that encourage cities to invest in low-emission and climate-resilient infrastructure. Also, it urges cities to adopt frameworks that put a price on carbon, such as cap-and-trade mechanisms or traffic congestion charges. Finally, it recommends strengthening banks and institutions that will support cities in developing investment-worthy climate-related projects. It suggests that international development finance be directed through local financial institutions, which are well-positioned to help cities finance climate-smart infrastructure solutions.
Members of the Alliance gathered under the Project Preparation Action Group (PPAG) to develop a joint understanding of the early stage Project Preparation issues impeding demand to meet supply.  Several Knowledge Products are produced so far and a ‘Subnational Project Preparation Practitioner’s Forum’ was organised in November 2018 enabling Project Preparation Practitioners and Project Preparation Facilities (PPFs) to share their lessons learned and increase cooperation in Mexico. The Action Group plans to undertake many activities in the next two years to foster co-operation among PPFs and facilitate easier access to climate finance for cities across the world.","Technical dialogue,  Political dialogue,  Capacity building","Knowledge dissemination and exchange,  Awareness raising and outreach,  Training and education",,"The Cities Climate Finance Leadership Alliance aims to mobilize finance for city-level climate action at scale by 2030 mainly through amplifying ambition and engagement for city-level finance and by bridging the demand and supply along the investment chain for city-level climate-related finance.

Launched in 2014, the Africa Clean Energy Corridor (ACEC) is an initiative that aims to transform the current fuel mix by promoting the development of clean, indigenous and cost-effective renewable power options and to create a regional market for the trade of renewable power. ACEC now includes more than 30 governments, regional organisations, development partners and financial institutions and there is a growing interest from new partners to join.
Thanks to the successes achieved in East and Southern Africa, the West Africa Clean Energy Corridor was initiated in 2016 .","The Clean Energy Corridors in Africa aim to meet the continent’s fast-growing electricity needs through the accelerated development of renewable energy potential and cross-border trade of renewable power within the Eastern and Southern African Power Pools as well as within the West Africa Power Pool.
Work on the initiative spans five main pillars: 
1. Zoning and Resource Assessment to site renewable power plants in areas with high resource potential and suitable transmission routes.
2. National and Regional Planning to consider cost-effective renewable power options.
3. Enabling Frameworks for Investment to open markets and reduce financing costs.
4. Capacity Building to plan, operate, maintain and govern power grids and markets with higher shares of renewable electricity generation.
5. Public Information and Awareness to raise awareness on how the corridor can provide secure, sustainable and affordable energy.","The activities undertaken by the initiative all fall under its five pillars. So far, under the Renewable Energy Resource Assessment and Zoning pillars:
Resource Assessment: 
Africa Clean Energy Corridor:
- Development of the zoning methodology for the identification of high resource potential and cost-effective power generation zones, which has been validated by stakeholders from utilities, government, regulatory bodies, power pools and academia within the region.
- Collection of extensive data from EAPP and SAPP countries on their renewable energy resource potential, existing and planned grid transmission infrastructure and road networks, protected areas, national electricity load profiles and infrastructure expansion costs, for use in the zoning analysis.
- Identification of renewable energy zones in the EAPP and SAPP member countries and presenting these to stakeholders, highlighting developable areas for wind and solar (both utility-scale photovoltaic and concentrated solar power) technologies.
- A regional workshop organised in Namibia in April 2017 enabled data gathering on the sites earmarked for development. This output provided a basis for financial viability analyses, which aims to inform power procurement procedures in the relevant countries as well as the regional planning processes. In that regard, the financial viability and suitability of 18 project sites have been assessed within the ACEC zones to guide renewable investments. The results of this assessment are being considered by some of the countries in designing their tendering processes as well as guiding their interactions with potential solar and wind project developers.
West Africa Clean Energy Corridor:
- Completion of a suitability analysis work for solar and wind which helped to identify the area of high potential in the region and will be used as basis for the future zoning work under WACEC
- Conduct of scoping study for the solar component of the WACEC aiming to install 2 GW of Solar by 2030 in West Africa (funded under the ongoing European Union Energy Initiative’s Technical Assistance Facility). 
- Initiation of financial viability analyses for sites earmarked for Solar and Wind project development. In that regard, 14 sites have been assessed in Mali and Togo and 10 are under assessment in Nigeria. Other countries such as Senegal have expressed their interest in the service

National and Regional Planning
Africa Clean Energy Corridor:
-Development of least-cost System Planning Test models to support planning for long-term power generation expansion plans (over the next 20 – 40 years) in continental Eastern and Southern African countries. These models also allow policy makers to assess least-cost investment options in light of a specific policy goal, such as a renewable energy penetration target, import independence, affordability or CO2 targets, in order to assess investments in international transmission lines for renewable energy deployment. The tools have been made available and regional training seminars were held, with the attendance of more than 50 energy planners in total.
- Ongoing work has also been initiated to incorporate the zoning results into regional planning in Eastern and Southern Africa power pools.
- Support was provided to Swaziland through a 10-month capacity building programme for the development of and Energy Master plan for enhancing energy security, affordability and environmental sustainability based on the results of the zoning exercise. The Energy Master plan will be adopted and followed by energy planning capacity building programme to strengthen the country’s implementation capacity.
Development of the ACEC is guided by a communiqué, endorsed during the Fourth Assembly of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in ACEC. 
West Africa Clean Energy Corridor: 
- Development of the “Planning and Prospects for Renewable Energy in West Africa” report taking into account the new model input data and national renewable deployment scenarios using SPLAT-W country models coming out of a six-month capacity-development programme in 2015/16 organised by IRENA and the ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE), in collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
- Initiation of a capacity building programme to establish a national energy planning unit for energy statistics and long-term energy planning taking into account cost effective renewable energy options in Sierra Leone.
- Contribution to the update of the West Africa Power master plan, by providing input to support the collection of reliable data on renewable energy resource potential, costing as well as capacity building on planning and project facilitation

Enabling Frameworks: to attract Investments
- Guidance provided, through Renewables Readiness Assessments, to Djibouti, Gambia, Ghana, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Senegal, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe on the development of enabling policy, legislative and institutional frameworks.
- Launch of the Sustainable Energy Marketplace (SEM) for project initiation, development and financing. SEM brings together renewable energy project owners, governments, financiers, and service/technology providers to enhance the understanding of the market and the capabilities of project owners in a transparent and structured way.
- Support provided to the Regional Electricity Regulators Association for Southern Africa (RERA) to develop a knowledge base on regulatory actions supporting renewable energy development in the region.
- Cooperation with national regulators and RERA, ministries, utilities and academia to enhance investment frameworks for wind and solar PV. This engagement has developed an assessment, in two pilot ACEC countries (Namibia and Zimbabwe) as well as the entire SAPP region, on how existing planning processes can be amended, including the empowerment of the regulatory roles to provide greater investment certainty and ensure timely project delivery; deepened the understanding of auction practices and impacts in sub-Saharan Africa (South Africa, Uganda, Zambia); principles for designing bankable power purchase agreements for renewable energy in Southern Africa and further details related to efficient project development and approval.

Capacity Building
Africa Clean Energy Corridor:
- Holding capacity-building workshops related to the renewable power zoning process in the EAPP and SAPP regions. The workshops, attended by ministries, utilities, regulatory bodies, and academics, presented preliminary study results and provided a platform for explaining the zoning process and methodology.
- Organization of training seminars on energy planning and the use of planning tools for the ACEC countries, which were attended by energy planning officers, utility planners and academics.
- Holding the first IRENA Renewable Energy Training Week on regulation. The continuing training week series inform decision makers in governance bodies and industry about the possible paths for the development and integration of renewable resources into today’s power systems.
- Organization of the Southern Africa Renewable Energy Statistics Workshop for building capacities in the collection, processing and dissemination of renewable energy data as well as the construction of national renewable energy balances. Other topics covered at this training workshop included: renewable energy costs; resource assessment; energy production from bagasse (field trip); and estimation of renewable energy production from international trade statistics about imports of equipment (solar panels and solar water heaters).
- Series of trainings on strategic long-term energy planning through the use of IRENA’s System Planning Model (SPLAT-SW) for Swaziland.
West Africa Clean Energy Corridor:
- Initiation  in partnership with the relevant regional institutions, of a capacity building programme with the end-goal of facilitating regional market integration. This capacity building programme put the focus on the development of renewable energy PPAs as well as the planning and operation of grids with higher shares of variable renewable power.
- The component on the planning and operation of grids with higher shares of variable renewable power was kicked-off in Dakar in December 2017 and will be completed by end of June 2018
- The component on the development of RE PPA was kicked-off in January 2018 and will be completed by end of August 2018.
These two activities will be followed by a three-year capacity building programme aiming to address all the issues identified by the gap analysis.

The initiative builds upon the strong political commitment of African leaders to strengthen regional institutions and transmission infrastructure and forming large competitive markets. By creating a larger regional electricity market, the ACEC could attract investments to meet 40-50% of power needs in the EAPP and SAPP regions by 2030. ACEC investment needs up to 2030 are estimated at USD 20 billion – USD 25 billion per year in generation, with an additional USD 15 billion for grid infrastructure. Combined efforts will diversify resource availability, improve energy security and foster investment opportunities and job growth. Scaling up renewable energy through the ACEC also offers a comprehensive opportunity to avoid lock-ins with carbon-intensive infrastructure and leapfrog towards a low-carbon future with a 2,500 Mt savings of cumulative CO2 between 2015 and 2030. The initiative also facilitates the coordination between environment and energy ministries.
The West Africa Clean Energy Corridor (WACEC), through the Solar component, is aiming to achieve 2 GW of solar capacity over the 2014-2020 period. The objectives of the initiatives is facilitated through the pillars mentioned below: - Zoning and Resource Assessment – to site renewable power plants in areas with high resource potential and suitable transmission routes; - National and Regional Planning – to fully consider cost-effective renewable power options; - Enabling Frameworks for Investment – to open markets and reduce financing costs; - Capacity Building – to plan, operate, maintain and oversee power grids and markets with higher shares of renewable electricity generation; - Public Information and Awareness – to raise awareness on how large-scale renewables can provide secure, sustainable and affordable energy

I4CE, 20-22 rue des petits hotels 75010 Paris – France","The current governance structure of the initiative comprises two bodies:
1)    The Supporting Institutions Assembly consists of all financial institutions whose management has publically confirmed its support for the Climate Action in Financial Institutions Initiative and acknowledged the guidance provided by the voluntary Principles for Mainstreaming Climate Action within Financial Institutions. Supporting Institutions have also confirmed their interest in participating (on a voluntary basis) in the ongoing knowledge sharing and development of emerging operational approaches and practices linked to the voluntary Principles. The Assembly takes responsibility for high-level decisions, while day-to-day decisions are delegated to the Coordination Group.
2) The Coordination Group is a permanent body (with rotating membership of Supporting Financial Institutions) and which is supported by a secretariat. In 2018, representatives of 7 supporting institutions were nominated to undertake this role in its first term, each of them represents a constituency of Supporting institutions.
• EBRD and IADB representing Multilateral development banks
• AFD and BOAD representing International/bilateral/regional/national development banks
• HSBC representing Developed country commercial financial institutions
• YES BANK and BMCE Bank of Africa representing Developing country commercial financial institutions
3 ) The Secretariat is an independent entity that supports the Coordination Group for the implementation of its various tasks. Among its responsibilities, the Secretariat provides in depth inputs to the different work streams and the construction of the annual work plan and assists the Coordination Group in the organisation of meetings and the internal and external outreach of the initiative.
Since late 2016, the Coordination Group has selected the Institute for Climate Economics (I4CE) to house the Secretariat.",Global,I4CE,Academic/Research institution,France,"The Climate Action in Financial Institutions Initiative is an unprecedented coalition of 44 public and private financial institutions around the globe aiming to adopt a pathway to systematically integrate climate change considerations across their strategies, programs and operations. The Initiative is guided by 5 voluntary Principles for Mainstreaming Climate Action within Financial Institutions:
1.	COMMIT to climate strategies;
2.	MANAGE climate risks;
3.	PROMOTE climate smart objectives; 
4.	IMPROVE climate performance;
5.	ACCOUNT for your climate action.","The Climate Action in Financial institutions Initiative intends through its 5 voluntary Principles to make climate change considerations a core component of how financial institutions conduct business, parallel to and in addition to the necessary development of appropriate regulatory and enabling environments at the domestic and international levels. They imply a shift from incremental financing of climate activities to ensuring that climate change – risk and opportunity – is a fundamental consideration through which financial institutions deploy capital.
Th initiative aims to provide public and private financial institutions an opportunity to learn from each other, to disseminate good practice and lessons learned and to collaborate on areas of common interest.","The work of the initiative includes three activities:
1. Knowledge Sharing within the Financial Community: The Initiative will be a platform for sharing knowledge on “how” financial institutions integrate climate considerations across operations. Knowledge sharing activities will happen along each of the 5 voluntary Principles.
2.Dissemination of Emerging Practices and Lessons Learned: Recognizing that financial institutions may vary in “how” they integrate climate considerations, and recognizing that approaches and emerging practices may be replicable in other institutions, the voluntary Principles will collect and disseminate examples of emerging practices, inclusive of the lessons learned through the implementation of those approaches.
3.Collaboration among Supporting Institutions on Areas of Common Interest: Recognizing that there may be many more examples of “emerging practice” under some voluntary Principles than others, Supporting Institutions expressed a desire to collaborate on the development of new/innovative approaches where few currently exist. Collaboration on new approaches, as well as the possibilities to harmonize existing climate mainstream approaches/tools will form part of the work of the Initiative.","At the 2018 Global Climate Action Summit, the 42 financial institutions participating in the Climate Action in Financial Institutions Initiative released a Joint Statement demonstrating how they are moving from commitment to action – both individually and collectively – in supporting local climate action: https://www.mainstreamingclimate.org/publication/joint-statement-of-the-supporting-institutions-of-the-climate-action-in-financial-institutions-initiative/
Aligned with the objectives of the ‘Talanoa Dialogue’, the Statement takes stock of over 40 new and existing commitments, programs and efforts of financial institutions supporting local climate action.
As to date there is no common definition of what Paris Alignment means and implies in practice, the Climate Action in Financial Institutions hosted an expert workshop on the sidelines of the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit to help fill this gap. The event was organized in partnership with the IDFC and the group of MDBS with support from the European Climate Foundation. It aimed to take stock of progress made and identify areas to move forward on Alignment with the Paris Agreement. Part of a series of workshops, which started at COP24 in Katowice, it brought together more than 80 experts on the topic of alignment from the financial institutions and research community.","Technical dialogue,  Political dialogue","Knowledge dissemination and exchange,  Awareness raising and outreach","Awareness raising and outreach — Events attended and or organisedYear2019Value (#)4

In line with the internationally agreed commitments to urgently address the threat of climate change, through 5 voluntary Principles the Initiative supports the global objectives of:
- holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5 °C,
- increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience, and
- making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.

- Climate risks: approaches, tools and methodologies
- Mapping reporting initiatives and understanding implementation challenges
- City-level climate smart approaches and financial instruments
- Spreading a climate strategy into a whole organization
Overarching goals for 2019-2020:
1. Assist operational teams in Supporting Institutions to access, understand, discuss and apply evidence and examples of how to “mainstream” climate change:
a)	Identifying and documenting current practice of financial institutions to mainstream climate change;
b)	Presenting overviews and disseminating existing relevant and useful  work;
2. Promote dialogue and ‘matchmaking’ between Supporting Institutions
a)	Support increased ambition and improved mainstreaming through peer-based exchanges and experience
b)	Support the development of new practice on emerging mainstreaming topics
3. Contribute to scale up and redirect financing toward investments and assets that are necessary for transitioning to low-carbon, resilient economies globally, and achieve ‘net zero’ carbon emissions in the long term.
a)	Demonstrate to the wider financial community how addressing climate change can be successfully done in practice while simultaneously achieving core institutional objectives.
b)	Contribute to international discussions on the frontiers of mainstreaming, such as the emerging topic of Paris Alignment and the rapidly developing topics of climate risk, adaptation, among others.",,The goals will be achieved through a series of targeted activities.,Goals are reviewed and updated by the Annual Assembly of the Initiative on an ad hoc basis depending on their current needs.,"Since 2018, the Initiative organises an Annual Assembly, technical workshops, webinars and produces materials such as case studies to disseminate lessons learned on emerging practice among its Supporting Institutions and with the broader financial community.","Progress are tracked by the Secretariat of the Initiative on a monthly basis for presentation to the Coordination Group.

areas that are already under cultivation, where sustainable productivity increases are achievable, or to areas that were previously degraded and are currently underused.
Increase recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples and rural communities over forests as a critical part of achieving clear and more coherent land and resource tenure.

It also addresses new deliveries of those aircraft that are already in-production from 2023. If they have not complied with the standard by 2028, they cannot be produced anymore. For context, approximately 40% of current production aeroplane type designs will need to be improved to meet the Standard.
Deliver the world’s first CO2 efficiency Standard for aircraft in February 2016. New standard will come into effect from 2020 and will apply to all new aircraft. Current aircraft will be phased in to the standard.",,"Publish the biannually report, “Aviation benefits beyond borders”.

This data-driven platform, which is similar to the one used by nations as they create national climate plans, will help direct resources and policies that better support and accelerate local climate actions. This, in turn, will drive and showcase innovative city level climate action, and inspire change at the global level. Through the Compact, cities are:
- Increasing their visibility as leaders responding to climate change; 
- Demonstrating their commitment to an ambitious global climate solution, particularly as nations convene around a new climate agreement in Paris in December 2015;
- Encouraging direct public and private sector investments in cities by meeting transparent standards that are similar to those followed by national governments;
- Building a consistent and robust body of data on the impact of city action; and
- Accelerating more ambitious, collaborative, and sustainable local climate action.","Any city or town in the world may commit to the Compact of Mayors—regardless of size or location. A city has up to three years to meet a series of requirements and fully comply, culminating in the creation of a full climate action and adaptation plan. To show compliance with the Compact cities have to pass 4 phases:
1) Register Commitment by mayor;
2) Take Inventory within one year of commitment (overall GHG inventory with Compact standard; identify climate risk; report);
3) Create Targets and Establish A System of Measurement within two years (update GHG inventory including breakdown by sources and sectors; set target to reduce GHG emissions; conduct ""climate change vulnerability assessment"" using the Compact standard; and report )

To reduce emissions by at least 50 percent by 2050, zero emission vessels (ZEVs) and by association zero emissions fuels are a requirement, since improvement in energy and operational efficiencies – while critically important – is not enough, especially as trade volumes continue to grow.
Achieving the 2050 target requires immediate action. Ships can be operated for 20 years or more, which means that the ships entering the world fleet around 2030 can be expected to be operational in 2050. Similarly, infrastructure associated with fuel supply chains can have a long economic life of up to 50 years, and reconfiguration to new fuels can be a lengthy process. As a consequence, there is a need to have technically feasible, commercially viable, and safe zero emission deep sea vessels entering the global fleet by 2030, as well as a clear path to provide the large amounts of zero carbon energy sources¹ needed to allow the rapid uptake of ZEVs in the following decades.
Decarbonizing shipping is an integral part of the wider global energy transition and can be leveraged to drive investment in energy projects, for instance in developing and middle-income countries, where low cost zero carbon energy sources derived from abundant untapped renewable resources could bring substantial development gains.","Coalition member companies from across the maritime, fuels and infrastructure value chains are committed to making the vision of decarbonized shipping a reality by getting commercially viable ZEVs into operation by 2030 along with the associated scalable infrastructure, and we invite our industry peers to join us in this “race to the top” for the future of our industry.
Achieving our ambition, will require commitment, perseverance, innovation and cross industry collaboration as well as the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders from beyond our industries, including from the public sector. We are therefore inviting governments, international organizations, and other stakeholders to work with us to achieve the vision of commercially viable and scalable solutions that enable ZEVs by 2030 and rapid growth of this fleet thereafter. Together we can take a giant leap towards the decarbonized, sustainable and affordable shipping industry needed for our global future.","The ambition of the Getting to Zero Coalition is to have commercially viable ZEVs operating along deep sea trade routes by 2030, supported by the necessary infrastructure for scalable zero-carbon energy sources including production, distribution, storage and bunkering².

Action-oriented: We will play our part to deliver tangible progress towards making deep-sea ZEVs and infrastructure/supply chains commercially viable by 2030 by working together as a coalition, by working in smaller partnerships, and by taking action at a company level, as appropriate.
Commercially viable: We will work with other stakeholders including lenders and investors, customers, energy companies as well as government and regulators to put the necessary financial incentives and business models in place to make ZEVs commercially viable and scalable at the global level by 2030.
Safe: We will work together to ensure that technologies and energy sources are safely adopted and operated, working with industry associations, regulatory bodies and appropriate stakeholders to ensure that relevant safety guidelines, rules and regulations are  drafted, implemented and adopted across the shipping and maritime fuels value chains.
Inclusive: We will collaborate with stakeholders including companies, governments, intergovernmental organisations, research institutions and NGOs to ensure that sustainable and inclusive growth of shipping becomes a key component of the work of the coalition and contributes to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

The EcoMobility World Festival series by ICLEI shows that an ecomobile lifestyle can be promoted in cities around the world. The Festival transforms a neighborhood or a business district in a city into car-free and ecomobile area for a month. Implementing the Festival demonstrates the possibilities of an innovative and forward-thinking urban mobility culture.
After two years of intensive preparation for the EcoMobility World Festival 2017, Kaohsiung transformed the streets of the historical Hamasen neighborhood into dedicated space for ecomobile modes of transport such as walking, cycling, and public transport and various forms of shared and light electric vehicles. Kaohsiung is the second city in Asia to showcase an autonomous shuttle in a real urban environment for the public to test-ride. Throughout October, 376 events were organized with 364 guided tours in Hamasen, attracting 300,000 visitors to the neighborhood and 90,000 visitors to the EcoMobility exhibition. As a result, 62 percent of private vehicle trips were replaced with ecomobile options.","Technical dialogue,  Political dialogue","Awareness raising and outreach,  Policy planning and recommendations",,"The EcoMobility Alliance is a network of cities committed to building a sustainable transport future ensuring low-carbon, people-centered and socially inclusive mobility options.

The EcoMobility SHIFT+ scheme is a total quality management tool created by academia, non-governmental organizations and cities for use and implementation in cities. The tool enables cities to measure the performance of urban mobility, to establish a baseline and to identify areas for further development, ultimately helping cities to change their urban transport development trajectory and mobility plans. 
By using EcoMobility SHIFT+ and acting upon the resulting assessments, cities will see improvements not only in the areas of transportation and mobility but also the urban environment and health. The SHIFT+ scheme uses two procedures: a procedure to assess a city’s performance and an audit procedure to verify performance. Using the results of both components, both short- and long-term improvement paths can be established.","EcoMobility Alliance Report 2018: https://ecomobility.org/wpdm-package/ecomobility-alliance-report-2018/?wpdmdl=65056

The Climate Group’s global EP100 initiative in partnership with the Alliance to Save Energy brings together a growing group of energy-smart companies committed to using energy more productively, to lower greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate a clean economy.  
By setting ambitious targets and integrating energy efficiency into business strategy, leading companies are driving clean tech innovation while delivering on emissions reduction goals – inspiring others to follow their lead.
The Climate Group estimates that if 100 companies double their energy productivity by 2030 – generating twice as much economic output for every unit of energy consumed – over 170 million metric tons of emissions could be avoided cumulatively, equivalent to taking 37 million cars off the road for a year.
Dalmia Cement, H&M and Johnson Controls are already on board. Is your company ready to play a leading role? 
The business case:
Saving energy is a sensible business decision that improves financial performance and also demonstrates commitment to staff and customers. 
From financial services and retail to automobile manufacturing and heavy industry, EP100 members are generating green growth, improving competitiveness, and banking substantial cost savings.
EP100 companies are also driving wider economic benefits by helping to reduce primary energy demand and advance energy efficient technologies. Research suggests this will add US$18 trillion to global GDP  through 2035.","To become a member of EP100, companies choose among three commitments:
Doubling energy productivity - A company doubles the economic output from every unit of energy it consumes globally within 25 years, with a baseline year of 2005 at the earliest. The company chooses a relevant energy productivity metric (e.g. revenue/GJ of energy) and reports on its progress annually. 
Increasing energy productivity enables a company to grow more sustainably; doubling it demonstrates the highest level of climate leadership. 
Cutting out energy waste - A company with commercial buildings or industrial manufacturing space implements a smart energy management system (EnMS) globally within 10 years or sooner and commits to an energy productivity target. 
Stopping energy waste is the name of the game, and continual improvements are key. Energy savings are reported annually, and companies that already have a EnMS may join.
Owning and operating energy-smart buildings - A company commits to owning, occupying or developing buildings that operate at net zero carbon by 2030, with energy efficiency as a core component. This pathway helps companies to understand what their emissions are at an asset and portfolio level, and to use proven verification means to reach net zero carbon emissions. 
This Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment is led by the World Green Building Council as part of EP100.","The Climate Group shares the compelling business case for increasing energy efficiency, encourages knowledge-sharing and peer-learning through webinars and events, and showcases member leadership through speaking slots at key events, digital media and media outreach.
EP100 is delivered as part of the We Mean Business coalition. Alongside renewable power and electric vehicles, making smarter use of energy is one of three practical steps companies can take to lower their emissions, future-proof their business and demonstrate climate leadership.",,Implementation,Goal setting (ex-ante),Goal setting (ex-ante) — Stakeholders who have committed to the goalsYear2030Value (#)100Goal setting (ex-ante) — Total MitigationYear2030Value (MtCO2e/yr)170,"Companies can join EP100 by committing to one of three commitment areas: doubling energy productivity, implementing global energy management systems (EnMS), or commit to owning, managing or occupying net-zero carbon buildings (NZCB) by 2030.

WFP is developing new tools to help mitigate and manage risks by translating early warning into early action, as a way to strengthen community, government and regional organization’s capacities to prepare for early response, and recover from climate-driven shocks. 
WFP is establishing FoodSECuRE as a unique and single institutional mechanism to respond to increasing risks that climate change poses on food security. FoodSECuRE will: i) trigger action based on climate forecasts, to reinforce community resilience before shocks occur; ii) support early action during a large-scale climate-disaster through support to government-led response mechanisms (e.g. parametric climate risk insurance) and iii) provide multi-year financing to deliver high-quality resilience-building activities are undertaken during post-disaster recovery operations. 
Medium Term:
By 2020, WFP plans to have FoodSECuRE established and fully operational in at least the 5 phase one countries (Guatemala, Niger, Philippines, Sudan, and Zimbabwe). This involves having early action plans established and tested, a monitoring framework developed, seasonal climate forecast and trigger mechanism set-up and national capacity built, the cost benefit analysis support lessons learnt, and country contingency fund is accessible.
Long Term:
Through its new Climate Policy and using the SDGs to guide long-term action, WFP will take an iterative, phased approach to managing uncertainty related to climate change, using its experience across the humanitarian-development continuum to apply integrated risk management approaches to build national and community-level resilience.
In 2013, WFP repositioned its work on food security and climate change as an innovation area through the Organizational Strengthening and Fit for Purpose process; in 2015 we moved to looking at mechanisms to mainstream climate change adaptation into projects, with a core aim to build the capacities of governments. In 2016, WFP has been developing its Policy on Climate Change: Responding to the Food Insecurity and Nutrition Impacts of Climate Change, which is expected to be approved by the Executive Board in February 2017. 
The climate change policy defines how WFP will contribute to national and global efforts to prevent climate change from undermining work to end hunger. The policy provides WFP staff with guiding principles on how to integrate action to address climate change in their work. Innovative climate risk finance mechanisms like FoodSECuRE are core building blocks of how WFP addresses the risks from climate change.  
A climate action plan will outline how this policy will be implemented, using extra-budgetary resources, in order to build staff capacities, integrate specialized climate change funding into its financial framework, and develop more specific guidance for staff and partners. WFP will also continue its leadership in scaling up innovative tools and approaches, to develop more predictable immediate-response financing for climate disasters, and to work with governments to attract climate financing towards activities aligned with national plans and priorities under the UNFCCC.  
While FoodSECuRE is being established as a global corporate mechanisms to deploy forecast-based financing, other initiatives like the German funded Forecast-based Emergency Preparedness for Climate Risks (FbF) work on linking extreme weather forecasts with preparedness procedures and activities before an event occurs. Early warning indicators and thresholds are being determined and linked to pre-defined Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for preparedness actions at government levels. Forecast-based emergency preparedness reduces costs for humanitarian response after the disaster strikes. In its initial phase, this project is setup in five pilot countries: Philippines, Nepal, Bangladesh, Haiti, and Dominican Republic. 
Both FoodSECuRE and the Forecast-based Emergency Preparedness for climate risks represent critical efforts by WFP to develop, test and deploy forecast-based financing modalities in support of improved preparedness and early community action. The lessons learned from the forecast-based preparedness project will be critical for informing the development of the second phase of FoodSECuRE.  Likewise, by closely coordinating technical work and learning in developing forecast trigger systems, SOPs, and underlying climate analyses to support both initiatives be mutually reinforcing and promise to accelerate the development of this important new approach. Both initiatives, build on significant WFP investments in climate risk analysis carried out through C-ADAPT.
WFP is currently fundraising to make the facility fully operational.",,,,"WFP has selected in coordination with FAO and IRI using a set of pre-agreed criteria five countries for phase one testing and implementation: Guatemala, Niger, Philippines, Sudan and Zimbabwe. The FoodSECuRE implementation plan has been developed to guide implementation and details the proposed process and framework:
In addition to this, the establishment of FoodSECuRE as a corporate mechanism for forecast-based action and to respond to climate risks will entail the following steps: 
•	Setting-up a climate forecast and trigger mechanism for anticipatory action in partnership with the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) at Columbia University (USA).
•	Development and integration of the African Risk Capacity (ARC) matching/replica policy framework under the FoodSECuRE framework to support government led early response.
•	Develop country specific operational procedures for implementation of early/anticipatory action and early response (integrating to national early warning systems).  
•	Development of a financial framework (fund structure) to ensure efficient programming of contributions, budgeting and resource management in line with WFP’s financial systems. 
•	Development of the monitoring, evaluation and learning (M&E) framework to measure the effectiveness of the FoodSECuRE mechanisms in building resilience in populations both in response to the trigger mechanism before a shock as well as after the shock has occurred. 
•	Conduct a cost benefit analysis (CBA) to determine the potential cost efficiency and cost effectiveness of the FoodSECuRE model, early action based on climate forecasts as compared with the costs of conventional humanitarian response to a disaster, and multi-year resilience building of communities in the post-disaster recovery operations. 
•	Development of a resource mobilization both for the start-up and testing of FoodSECuRE and for its long term contingency financing, linked to climate finance. Donor consultations are on-going process.","At the current stage WFP is only field testing the facility on small-scale in two countries (Zimbabwe and Guatemala), applying a standard M&E framework, food security analysis using modelling and house hold economy approaches. For the future WFP is developing a Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) Strategy tracking the progress of the initiative through output, outcome and impact level monitoring and evaluation. The frameworks will measure the extent to which the FoodSECuRE can contribute to positive food and nutrition security through protection of community assets. Furthermore, it will measure whether recovery time from a shock is ‘reasonable’ and whether the selected activities are cost-effective.

Facilitating the sustainable development of bioenergy
In December 2011 GBEP agreed upon a set of 24 relevant, practical, science-based, voluntary sustainability indicators for bioenergy. These indicators and the respective methodology sheets, which address the production and use of all forms of bioenergy, are intended to guide any analysis of bioenergy undertaken at the domestic level with a view to informing decision making and facilitating the sustainable development of bioenergy. The GBEP sustainability indicators for bioenergy and the related report are the result of the work of the Task Force on Sustainability that GBEP established in June 2008 under the leadership initially of the United Kingdom and then (since November 2010) of Sweden. The GBEP sustainability indicators also take on the work of the GBEP Task Force on GHG Methodologies (established in October 2007 under the joint leadership of the United States and the UN Foundation) and specifically on “The GBEP Common Methodological Framework for GHG Lifecycle Analysis of Bioenergy” released in January 2011 for the use of policymakers and stakeholders when assessing GHG emissions associated with bioenergy.
The GBEP work on sustainability indicators responds directly to the mandates GBEP received from G7/G20 Leaders in the last few years and facilitates the implementation of Agenda 21, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It also represents a contribution to the Sustainable Energy for All Initiative (SE4All).
The GBEP indicators are currently in the implementation phase. As of June 2018, the GBEP indicators had been implemented in twelve countries (i.e. Argentina, Colombia, Egypt, Germany, Ghana, Indonesia, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Netherlands, Paraguay and Viet Nam) and additional five countries were in the process of implementing them (see map in the Annex). Since 2015, in light of the lessons learned collected, the GBEP Task Force on Sustainability (currently under the leadership of Egypt, Italy and Japan) has been working on the development of an Implementation Guide on the use of the GBEP Sustainability Indicators for Bioenergy, to improve their practicality and related guidance for users.
2.  Facilitating capacity building for sustainable bioenergy
In May 2011 GBEP established a Working Group on Capacity Building for Sustainable Bioenergy, initially co-led by The Netherlands and the United States of America and then (since December 2013) by Argentina and ECOWAS. The Group aims to raise awareness of the potential benefits of sustainable modern bioenergy building on the work previously developed by GBEP and to facilitate collaboration among its Partners and Observers. The Working Group has been focusing on the followings: 
	Sustainable Modern Bioenergy in the ECOWAS region. Four forums were organized with the aim to initiate a regional dialogue to support the development of regional and national bioenergy strategies, with a view to further facilitate effective policy planning for a sustainable bioenergy sector in the region. This activity supported the development of a Regional Strategy on Bioenergy that was adopted by ECOWAS Ministers of Energy at the end of 2012 and validated by ECOWAS Governments in September 2015.
	Raise awareness and share data and experience on the implementation of GBEP indicators. Several workshops were organized over the last years to share very interesting experiences and lessons learned from the pilot testing of the GBEP sustainability indicators in various countries. These events highlighted that the indicators are useful tools to catalyze flow of data from the bioenergy sector to research and government that will then use it to develop policies to guide the industry practices.
	Study Tour for Capacity Building. Bioenergy Weeks are organized in different regions of the world as opportunities for scientists and officials to learn from positive experiences in the sustainable production and use of bioenergy that could guide the design and implementation of bioenergy policies. Furthermore they create opportunities to continue a dialogue with private sector and stakeholders on ways to improve mutual cooperation towards a more sustainable production and use of bioenergy. Bioenergy Weeks, focused on the priorities and concerns of the respective regions, were held in Brasil (2013), Mozambique (2014), Indonesia (2015), Hungary (2016), Ghana (2016), Argentina (2018), Philippines (2019) and Ethiopia foreseen in 2020.
	Sustainable modern wood energy development, to discuss sustainable production and use of wood energy for household and productive local uses, primarily in developing countries. A report was developed to give an overview of the status of wood energy development in developing countries. Further discussions on the recommendations included in this wood energy report and on how GBEP could contribute to address those recommendations followed, as well as a Workshop in Benin (May 2016) to share best practices and learn from positive experiences in the field of wood energy management in Africa. 
	Capacity building and activities on bioenergy mapping. GBEP discussed about the role of mapping to collect relevant information for the measurement of the GBEP indicators and contributed to populate the IRENA Global Bioenergy Atlas.
	Bioenergy and Water. Between 2014 and 2017 GBEP has been working to identify and disseminate ways of integrating bioenergy systems into agriculture and forestry landscapes to improve sustainable management of water resources. 
	Biogas. Newly establish group to share best practices and lessons learned in the biogas sector.

GFEI is a partnership between 6 organisations that promote further research, discussion and action to improve fuel economy worldwide and transition to low carbon, zero emission (at tailpipe) technologies. GFEI's core activities are data development and analysis of fuel economy potentials, support for national and regional policy-making efforts and outreach and awareness raising to stakeholders (e.g. vehicle manufacturers).","GFEI is about accelerating the rapid transition to the most efficient, zero emission vehicles globally – saving money, energy and tackling climate change. This means securing real improvements in fuel economy, and the maximum deployment of low carbon technologies in vehicles across the world. The initiative has a target of improving average fuel economy of light duty vehicles by 2030 for new vehicles (compared with a 2005 baseline), and includes electric and hybrid technology.
The GFEI partners recognize the importance of supporting government actions and policies that bring the transportation sector into compliance with the Paris Climate Agreement. GFEI’s analysis shows that continued improvements in vehicle efficiency plus the aggressive introduction of electric vehicles (EVs), combined with decarbonisation of the electric grid, can achieve a 55-70% reduction in fleetwide CO2 emissions by 2050 for road vehicles.
GFEI has also expanded its focus to include Heavy Duty Vehicles, and has set the aim of a 35 per cent improvement by 2035 (based on a 2005 baseline), and 80 per cent by 2050.
GFEI has also set new targets for two- and three- wheelers and buses. For 2/3 wheelers these are to cut per km CO2 emissions by 80% by 2035 and 95% by 2050.
For urban transit buses, the targets are to cut per km emissions by 65% by 2035 and 95% by 2050.
Decarbonizing the electricity grid is crucial to meet emissions targets for the global vehicle fleet.

Communique. GGA member countries and partners are not required to contribute a membership fee.",Global,International Renewable Energy Agency – IRENA,International organisation,United Arab Emirates,"The Global Geothermal Alliance (GGA) is designed to ramp up the share of geothermal energy in the global energy mix both in the areas of geothermal power generation and the direct use of geothermal heat. The GGA serves as a  platform for dialogue and knowledge-sharing among governments, international financing institutions, private sector investors and other practitioners as well as a coalition for action to increase the share of installed geothermal electricity and heat generation worldwide.","Key objectives of the Alliance are to:
- identify and promote models for sharing and reducing risks associated with the geothermal business to be able to attract timely and efficient private investments and to integrate geothermal facilities into energy markets.
- help create enabling regulatory and institutional conditions for timely and efficient private investments and efficient operation of geothermal resources and associated network infrastructure.
- help streamline ongoing outreach and awareness-raising efforts in order to give geothermal energy greater visibility in the energy and climate debates at global, regional and national level.
The alliance goal is a five-fold growth in the installed capacity for geothermal power generation and at least two-fold growth for geothermal heating by 2030, compared to 2014 levels.",Areas of support would include the creation of enabling regulatory and institutional conditions for investment; the promotion of innovative financing and risk mitigation mechanisms for geothermal drilling; the design of effective incentive schemes for geothermal power supply and direct use; and capacity building and technical assistance f.,Eastern Caribbean countries embrace international geothermal resource classification system (joint IRENA-IGA-World Bank/ESMAP project under the umbrella of the Global Geothermal Alliance): https://www.irena.org/newsroom/articles/2018/Dec/Caribbean-Embraces-New-Geothermal-Resource-Classification,"Political dialogue,  Technical dialogue,  Capacity building,  Implementation","Policy planning and recommendations,  Knowledge production and innovation,  Training and education,  Knowledge dissemination and exchange,  Awareness raising and outreach,  Advocacy,  Goal setting (ex-ante)","Knowledge dissemination and exchange — Workshops and meetings for exchanging the knowledgeYear2016201720182019Value (#)2253

Contribute to the realisation of geothermal energy potential to achieve a five-fold growth in the global installed capacity for geothermal power generation and two-fold growth for geothermal heating by 2030
The Action Plan adopted by all Member Countries in 2016 envisages four priority action areas.
1.	Mapping of geothermal resources as well as identification of existing and potential geothermal markets and near terms projects in the pipeline. 
2.	Scoping of the needs for assistance to countries with transformative potential with a view to contributing to the removal of obstacles of policy, regulatory, funding or capacity building nature.
3.	Supporting the development of effective enabling frameworks and associated mechanisms to achieve national objectives for geothermal energy deployment. 
4.	Establishing a robust global network of geothermal practitioners building upon existing networks. Additionally, the GGA aims to promote geothermal energy’s role in supporting decarbonisation strategies and the implementation of their Nationally Determined Contributions.","The CO2 reduction goal is taken from the report: ""Individual actors, collective initiatives and their impact on global greenhouse gas emissions"", New Climate, PBL, and Yale 2018.",,,"Since the launch of the initiative, efforts have focussed on the operationalization of the Alliance. To this end, through an intensive consultative process within the GGA constituency a concise plan of action for the Alliance (GGA Action Plan) was finalized and endorsed by the GGA Members in May 2016.
The later years prove that geothermal is a great option for decarbonising heating and cooling. The initial goal set in 2014 (more than two-fold growth) has already reached 52%. The installed capacity for heating applications went from 70GWt in 2015 is over 100GWt in 2020. For this reason, through an Energy Compact, that goal was updated to three-fold growth in geothermal heating and cooling in 2030 compared to the 2014 levels. This shows that the work of the GGA, its partners and members and other geothermal stakeholder has paid off in installed capacity growth and actual geothermal heat utilisation.
Following recommendations from leaders in the Florence Declaration, issued at the first High-Level Conference in 2017, the GGA began a focused work on direct use. In April 2018, IRENA co-organised the event “Geothermal Direct Utilisation and Food Security” with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Iceland and the Iceland Geothermal Cluster. During the meeting, key factors behind successful experiences were identified, lessons shared, and partnerships highlighted. Outcomes and case studies from the workshop were presented and discussed at the regional level. This process formed the basis of the IRENA publication entitled Accelerating geothermal heat adoption in the agri-food sector: Key lessons and recommendations, launched in January 2019. Follow-up capacity building for policy-makers and key stakeholders are under preparation. 
Furthermore, through collaboration with key partners, the Alliance is promoting standardisation in the way resource assessments are classified and reported to promote a better understanding of the true potential and value of geothermal prospects. In this regard, a project with IRENA, International Geothermal Association and World Bank/ESMAP  trained more than 100 local stakeholder and tested the application in pilot countries (Indonesia, Ethiopia, and a cluster of Eastern Caribbean islands) of the Specifications for the application of the United Nations Framework Classification for Fossil Energy and Mineral Reserves and Resources 2009 (UNFC-2009) to Geothermal Energy Resources. To this end, three technical sessions were held in Indonesia (Match 2018), St. Lucia (Dec 2018), and Ethiopia (Feb 2019).","Monitoring of installed capacity for the power sector and generation for the heat sector.

The Haga Initiative is a business network that strives to reduce the business sector’s climate impact. We are a platform for companies who are committed to reduce their climate impact in order to achieve the Haga Initiative’s vision of a profitable business sector without climate impact. The way forward for the Haga Initiative is to engage companies from different industries and highlight the ween ambitious climate strategies and increased profitability.
At the same time, the companies in the Haga Initiative show that an effective work with climate responsibility creates concrete economic advantages. Therefore, the Haga Initiative wants to inspire other companies to set stricter emission targets and openly and transparently disclose their climate efforts through annual climate reports.
What do we want to achieve? A profitable business sector in Sweden, Europe and the world that takes environmental and climate issues seriously and that has identified the inherent possibilities in the climate transformation.

New targets definition
Scope 1: The target is net zero emission by 2030. This is translated into at least a 85 percent reduction in emissions from the company’s own operations, in scope 1, compared with a post- 1990 base year of their choice. To reach net zero emissions, the remaining emissions can be reduced through carbon offsets. The aim is a fossil fuel free company. Exception: If the company can show significant emission reductions, that are measurable, in other scopes.
Scope 2: Purchased energy in scope 2 should be renewable or recycled.
Scope 3: Emissions in scope 3 (upstream and downstream) are to be mapped out and identified.

The SMC work is now being continued as a task within the Electronic Devices and Networks Annex (EDNA).
Technology Forcing Standards for Energy Efficiency:
This report provides examples of where technology forcing standards have been applied and their impact, and how they compare to other policy interventions.  It goes on to examine the potential for this type of policy measure to stimulate energy efficiency in appliances and equipment at a greater pace than is being achieved by most current national policy approaches. 
Policy Driven Innovation (PDI):
This project seeks to show high-level government officials how ambitious energy productivity goals can be achieved through internationally coordinated efficiency levels and longer-term performance targets for appliances and equipment.  This approach could provide increased regulatory certainty for industry and encourage the market entrance of new efficient technologies.
Engagement with International Standardisation Organisations:
Internationally-accepted product definitions, test methods, efficiency metrics, and performance classes often make it easier and faster for national governments to implement effective energy efficiency policies. When these national policies are based on international standards, manufacturers benefit as the costs of complying with disparate policies and certification requirements are reduced; consumers benefit from lower product costs and accelerated innovation; regulators benefit from enhanced transparency and clarity across economies and lower administrative costs, and economies benefit from reduced barriers to trade.",,"Technical dialogue,  Political dialogue","Knowledge dissemination and exchange,  Norms and standard setting","Norms and standard setting — Standards or norms producedYear2017Value (#)1

Its aim is to support vulnerable countries to prepare against the impacts of climate shocks and disasters. Together with partners of the G20 and V20, the German government supported the launch of the InsuResilience Global Partnership in 2017
at the COP23 in Bonn. The Partnership connects almost 90 members, including G20 and V20 countries, the private sector, international organisations, civil society and academia. The goal of the InsuResilience Global Partnership is laid out in its Vision 2025, announced at the UN Secretary General´s Climate Action Summit in September 2019. As a global platform, the Partnership plays a central role within the international resilience community to ensure coherence of implementation efforts on climate and disaster risk finance across a diverse range of partners. 
28 programmes in 78 countries that work towards the goals of the InsuResilience Global Partnership are currently being established or are already active. The focus of the activities is to achieve early action and faster recovery through reliable funding of stand-by risk finance and insurance solutions. Additionally, the broader benefits of risk financing within adaptation strategies and planning are promoted.","The role of the Partnership is to promote and enable the adoption of disaster risk financing and insurance approachesas part of comprehensive disaster risk management strategies and integrated within preparedness, response and recovery plans that are anchored in country systems. It will do this through:
(1) Developing a global multi-stakeholder community that can generate and promote best practice in the use of climate and disaster risk finance and insurance (CDRFI).
(2) Facilitating efficient and coordinated global action to promote climate and disaster risk finance and insurance solutions.
(3) Empowering governments, businesses and households to become proactive risk managers through building capability and increasing access to knowledge and expertise, services, products and risk financing linked to disaster prevention, preparedness and response. 
(4) Building a network across sustainable development, social protection, disaster risk reduction, climate services and climate change adaptation communities to ensure risk financing is embedded within a comprehensive disaster risk management approach –both with respect to international fora as well as to in-country systems.

These actors are working on financial protection at the political, research and strategic level.",,,"The multi-stakeholder InsuResilience Global Partnership is transitioning towards a new monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) framework. The endorsement of the Partnership’s ‘Vision 2025’, with its six result areas in late 2019 was the first milestone towards a more comprehensive, holistic and partnership-wide monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) framework, with a focus on broadening impact dimensions and providing evidence on positive long-term impacts of CDRFI. This new MEL framework was developed in a collaborative process to involve different stakeholder perspectives. Members of the Partnership, including from civil society, private sector, implementing programs and academia, jointly developed a common terminology and formed a technical sounding board for the review process. The framework is complemented by a theory of change which identifies causal chains and links impacts directly to activities under the Partnership.
The framework consists of 19 indicators and corresponding targets that are clustered in six result areas. Each result area has a prominent lead indicator (such as the goal of reaching 500 million beneficiaries by 2025). The six result areas track progress on i.) Total risk covered and number of people protected, ii.) Number of countries with comprehensive disaster risk finance (DRF) strategy, iii.) Number of countries adopting CDRFI solutions, iv.) Increased cost effectiveness, v.) Development/human impact and vi.) Increase in evidence. Targets for these indicators were set in consideration of estimated baselines. 
The performance of the indicators will be measured in multiple ways: The InsuResilience Secretariat conducts annual data collections to measure beneficiaries, coverage volumes in relation to average annual losses and other quantitative indicators across all contributing programs and projects. This information is complemented by desk research, e.g. on the availability of countries’ DRF strategies. Moreover, a set of research questions and gaps in the field of impact evaluations will be addressed under a specific research plan, the evidence roadmap. Until 2025, the full toolbox of rigorous impact evaluation instruments shall be applied to identify and quantify impacts under the Partnership.
The new framework is exceptional in that it manages to provide a common methodology for reporting and aggregation of data, even across different types of financial solutions (from micro-level insurance to contingent credit) and the variety of projects it covers. 
The foundation of all components of the Partnership’s MEL are the InsuResilience Pro-poor Principles: Impact, Quality, Ownership, Complementarity and Equity. The principles were developed by the Partnership’s M&E Working Group and underwent a partnership-based review process similar to the M&E framework.","The overall achievements of the Partnership are documented in the Annual Reports.

ISA will work with partner countries in the identification of national opportunities to accelerate development and deployment of existing clean solar energy technologies, the potential for which largely remains untapped. The increased deployment of solar technologies will benefit the countries in terms of direct and indirect employment opportunities generated and the economic activity that will be triggered through electricity and solar appliance access to predominantly rural households. Across developing countries, it is mostly micro, small and medium enterprises that generate most of the economic activity and are the ones that benefit the most from electricity access, as they will be able to operate into the evening and increase their turnover. Increased deployment will also go a long way in realizing social benefits, for example through solar lanterns that improve educational outcomes from increased study hours, and lead to better health service delivery levels across communities. If a rural primary health clinic has solar lights, it is more likely to be staffed after dark, and therefore it is also more likely to be visited by those who need its services.","To achieve the objectives, ISA, by way of supplementing the national efforts of the member countries, through appropriate means will undertake following activities:
 Collaborations for joint research, development and demonstration, sharing information and knowledge, capacity building, supporting technology hubs and creating networks.

A notable number of cement facilities (CSI members and beyond) have reported their CO2 and energy data to the Getting the Numbers Right (GNR) database and the latest consolidated results (2014 data) were published in July 2016 (time lay due to antitrust compliance).
2016 celebrates the 10th year of reporting to the GNR. This round of reporting gather about 1,000 cement manufacturing sites around the world and measurement is carried out following to the CO₂ and Energy Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Cement Industry developed by CSI on the basis of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol designed by the WBCSD and the World Resource Institute (WRI).
GNR participants go beyond CSI member companies, with additional companies mainly headquartered in Europe and Latin America, reporting to the GNR through the support of their regional trade association, i.e. CEMBUREAU and FICEM respectively.
About 83% of these emissions are verified by an independent third party, which means that the process established by CSI 10 years ago is compatible with the requirements of the recent Paris Agreement.
As reporting is carried out on an annual basis, it constitutes a tracker of progress for the sector. The GNR is also a piloting tool for each company participating, enabling the company to benchmark itself against the average of the sector for each requested KPI.
It is important to continue enhancing the coverage of GNR reporting so to gather reliable data on performance of the cement sector globally in a consistent manner, it is the ideal tracking tool of the progress of the cement sector with regards to CO2 emissions.

Appeal to cement companies worldwide to solicit their support for the Cement LCTPi.
'Pursuing low-carbon technology roadmap development'
As soon as 2009, the CSI (in partnership with IEA) led the development of the WBCSD-IEA Cement Low Carbon Technology Roadmap, which was the first sectoral roadmap that was developed by IEA. This roadmap was based on several technology papers developed by ECRA representing the available and upcoming technology at that time. Seven years later, an update of these papers and new ones is necessary, it is being carried out now and a full update of the global roadmap is planned for 2017.
Development of CSI regional roadmap including India, Brail & Latin America and support similar development projects in other countries (e.g. Egypt and Kazakhstan).
Commencing development of a methodology for measurement of avoided emissions
Through the development of a robust methodology to provide meaningful estimation of the avoided emissions over the lifecycle of innovative cement products as compared to conventional cement products (market practice) and other construction materials. Henceforth, understand and measure the benefits brought upon.
Organizing the annual CSI Forum in December 2016 focusing on the theme of climate & energy (addressing both mitigation and adaptation issues)
The 2016 CSI Forum will also be the 10th of its kind and it will focus this year on Climate Change issues (mitigation and adaptation). Held in Madrid on December 13 and 14, 2016 it will gather stakeholders from the cement and concrete sector and will be open to other stakeholders to identify opportunities of cooperation. Exactly one year after the Paris agreement was adopted by 195 Parties, the cement sector will explain the actions taken during that year and the plans for the following years.
The statement of ambition of the cement LCTPi, elaborated under the leadership of CSI, is to enhance the coverage of the CSI field of activity to reach all cement manufacturers worldwide. If all cement manufacturers worldwide would apply the same ambitious targets as the ones of the proactive companies of CSI, CO2 emissions could be reduced in the range of 20 to 25% by 2030 compared to business as usual.
To move positively towards this aspirational goal, the cement sector has developed an action plan, based on 7 pillars:
1. Enhance the coverage of the sector’s CO2 emissions and energy consumption database, with a specific focus on China (more than 50% of cement worldwide production).
2. Enhance overall energy efficiency of the cement manufacturing process.
3. Scale-up the collection, availability and usage of good quality alternative fuels and raw materials, including relevant waste from other sectors in a circular economy approach.
4. Further reduce the clinker content in cement to minimize the share of this CO2-intensive intermediate product.
5. Develop new cements with reduced net CO2 emissions over the full life cycle.
6. Engage the full building and infrastructure value chain in local markets to identify and maximize the avoided emissions by usage of cement and concrete products.
7. Evaluate cross-sectoral initiatives, particularly on the opportunity to capture, use and store carbon (CCS-U).
Some of these actions have already started (see above) and others are longer-term actions that will be implemented over a couple of years.",,,,"The Cement LCTPi is working towards scaling-up its members’ efforts and leveraging the implementation of identified business solutions to a broader number of cement companies worldwide. Two new participants joined after COP 21: CNBM and China Resources Cement from China. More are expected to come in the next years.
The Cement LCTPi is working on: expanding the use of CSI tools on CO2 and energy measurement; enhancing energy efficiency of the cement manufacturing process; enhancing the use of alternative fuels and cement components; understanding avoided emissions in the use phase of concrete as a sustainable building material; and exploring novelties in the production process and developing new low-carbon cements.
The CSI has paved the way in the approach for emissions reduction across the entire sector, as early as 2009, the CSI (in partnership with IEA) led the development of the WBCSD-IEA Cement Low Carbon Technology Roadmap, which was the first sectoral
roadmap that was developed by IEA. This roadmap was based on several technology papers developed by ECRA representing the available and upcoming technology at that time. Seven years later, an update of these papers and new ones is necessary, it is being carried out now and a full update of the global roadmap is planned for 2017.
During 2016, extensive discussions and academic analysis were undertaken in Europe, North & South America as well as Asia to identify new technologies, to develop a non-competitive platform for common research on new low carbon cements, and to involve downstream users. These findings will be included in the continuous review and update of the CSI’s strategy and action plan on climate and energy, which is due for approval in December 2016.
The CSI has increased the granularity of its global low carbon technology roadmap through the development of regional roadmaps for India, Brazil and Latin America. These regional roadmaps outline existing and potential technologies available in the local context, and how they may help the industry support a halving of global CO2 emissions across all areas of business and society. They aim to help policy-makers and financial institutions work with the cement industry to adapt for a carbon-constrained world.
The customized version of the roadmap for India was developed in 2013. Since then, Indian cement companies have implemented energy efficiency solutions, in some cases exceeding the anticipated savings. International Finance Corporation (IFC) will partially fund the Indian roadmap’s phase 2 on resource efficiency studies in 2017 and the overall impact of the different measures undertaken will be assessed in 2018.
In Brazil, consultations for the development of the Brazilian roadmap continued in 2016, coordinated with the Brazilian cement associations and with participation from the industry, stakeholders and ministerial representatives. In September 2016, the launch of a roadmap project for the Latin American region was approved by the association’s Board of Directors, supported by local trade associations with a potential pilot program in Colombia.
During this year, discussions continued to explore the possibility of partnering with a Chinese research institute to carry out a scenario study to understand the emission reduction potentials of the cement industry in China. Discussion will continue in 2017 with local trade associations, including developing a customized version of the CO2 reporting protocol that can address specific regulatory requirements in the local context.","At present, the CSI’s GNR database is the initiative’s main tracking tool.
The CSI has also started developing a tool to track implementation progress. The finalization of this tool is expected for 2017 at the earliest.
July 2016 saw the publication of GNR data for 2014, as part of the CSI’s ongoing efforts to deliver uniform information. The report delivers accurate and verified data so that the industry can understand its own current and future performance potential.
GNR 2014 results were published in July 2016 and completed the first decade of GNR reporting. The report includes information from 934 facilities around the world, covering approximately 21% of global cement production, with 83% of the data independently assured (Figure 6). The one-year difference between data collection and publication is needed for anti-trust reasons, thus disconnecting the reported CO2 emissions from the current production volume.

Data shows that in 2014 the cement industry has continued to improve its emissions reductions. Specific net emissions (discounting the use of alternative fuels) are 19% below 1990 levels. Including the saved emissions achieved by using biomass, participating companies have avoided 110 million tons of CO₂ emissions. These results have been achieved by significant investment in more efficient kilns, higher fossil fuels substitution, increased use of biomass and improved clinker mineralogy, so that the clinker content of cement can be reduced.

This is a global forum that meets 2 times per year with a budget of approx $1M to cover a program of work including the initiative and other sustainability projects.",Global,Union Internacional de Chemin de fer (UIC),Network/Consortium/Partnership,France,"Scientific statements regarding climate change are alarming: even if countries around the globe meet their commitments made at COP 21 in 2015 for 2020, the planet will warm up by 3°C by the end of the century.
In order to stay in line with the Paris Agreement, countries need to multiply their ambitions threefold and carbon neutrality must be reached before 2050. According to the Paris Agreement, countries must renew or revise the climate commitments they submitted in 2015 (Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC)) upwards by the end of 2020. They must correspond to the “highest level of ambition possible”. The EU has already undertaken to increase its targets for 2030 and is also working under the European Green Deal to become the world’s first climate neutral continent by 2050.
UIC proposes to go one step further and is launching a communication campaign by revising some of the sector’s commitments, both at a European level and at a global level.
Railway climate responsibility pledge
At the UN Climate Summit in September 2014, UIC presented the Low Carbon Rail Transport Challenge – Technical Report. This initiative sets out a vision for the development of the railway sector at the global level as a sustainable alternative to other modes of transportation that are more carbon intensive, such as road transport and aviation. The challenge includes three sets of voluntary targets: to improve rail efficiency, to decarbonize electricity supply, and to achieve a more sustainable balance of transport modes.
At this time, European and global targets were designed to be complementary, whilst reflecting the different realities at European and world level.
UIC is committed to reducing specific final energy consumption per traffic unit (50% by 2030 and 60% by 2050) and specific average CO2 emissions per traffic units from train operations (50% by 2030 and 75% by 2050), all relative to a 1990 baseline.
In 2014, UIC also launched the Modal Shift Challenge, calling for investments that encourage a move to rail transport away from more carbon intensive transport options. The target was to achieve a 50% increase of the share of rail in passenger transport (in passenger-km) by 2030 compared to 2010, and a 100% increase by 2050. One key component of the Modal Shift Challenge was the Railway Climate Responsibility Pledge, which set out industry actions to complement the targets set for railways world-wide. During the Train to Paris high-level event in November 2015, this pledge was presented to high-level representatives of the United Nations. The Climate Responsibility pledge has been signed by more than 60 UIC members, representing most of global rail activity.
In 2019, UIC proposes to go one step further by aligning its 2050 CO2 emissions target to something that is becoming more and more widely shared as a consensual target to achieve the Paris Agreement: carbon neutrality by 2050 (instead of - 75% by 2050).
The Railway Climate Declaration has been proposed for signature to UIC Member at the UIC General Assembly by the end of 2019. Members were offered to consider the Declaration before the event via an official letter from UIC’s Director. At the UIC General Assembly, members were able to appose their signature on a symbolic paper, illustrating their support to the initiative. Some members also sent the signed declaration via mail, both canals allowing to gather 26 members by the end of 2019. In 2020, members were continuing considering the challenges proposed by this declaration, since it is also relying on the electricity supply or just finalising the signature process after the launch. Thus an additional 9 members were joining the initiative. The forthcoming evolution of participants will be depending on the communication around the initiative and members decarbonisation planning long term.","To reduce specific final energy consumption from train operations by: 50% reduction by 2030 and 60% reduction by 2050 (relative to a 1990 baseline);

According to the Paris Agreement, countries must renew or increase their commitments by the end of 2020, by amending their Nationally Determined Contributions submitted in 2015. They must correspond to the highest level of ambition possible. Therefore, UIC is committed to go further.
The Railway Climate Responsibility Pledge 2019 is an extension to the Pledge signed in 2015.
As an official representative of a UIC Member, I acknowledge the critical importance to take immediate action for a more sustainable future.
I recognise the central role of railways in the fight against climate change.
As a member of the worldwide community of railway operators and infrastructure managers, I commit to take a leading role in the actions to mitigate climate change, by reducing my company’s carbon footprint and supporting a shift towards a more sustainable balance of transport modes.
In order to achieve this, I commit to:
Reduce my company’s specific energy consumption and CO2 emission, and through this contribute to the UIC “Low Carbon Rail Transport Challenge”, presented in 2014 at the United Nations Climate Summit, and to the Rail Climate Responsibility Pledge, signed in 2015;

This commitment for the coordination of international food policies, the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact, has been subscribed by Mayors on the occasion of a major event during Expo 2015, dedicated to two of the most severe emergencies of the third millennium: food security and sustainable development.
The Pact is also an instrument of foreign politics for Milan, starting from the international networks our city is already member of: from its many  prominent sister cities to the C40 – Climate Leadership Group, the 69 large world cities committed to the fight against climate change. It was on the occasion of the C40 Summit in Johannesburg (February 2014) that Mayor Pisapia launched the proposal for a  Pact on urban food policies to his counterparts attending the meeting, to be signed during Expo 2015. In recent months, the “diplomats of the cities” have been collaborating with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the European Union and the United Nations, in order to engage the largest number of urban realities. 
The activities started in September 2014, when Milan and over 40 cities from every continent began to exchange views to define the contents of the Pact through video-conferences (webinars).
The results of this work were discussed at a meeting in London in February 2015, on which occasion standards and indicators to be included in the protocol have also been debated. The Pact has been signed by 100 cities, on 15 October 2015, with an official ceremony attended by the largest number of Mayors. The signed text has been presented to Ban Ki-Moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations on 16 October 2015.

At the launch, members committed to:
•	Seek to double their governmental and/or state-directed clean energy clean energy research, development and demonstration (RD&D) investments over five years.
•	Work closely with the private sector as it increases its investment in the earlier-stage clean energy companies that emerge from government programs.
•	Build and improve technology innovation roadmaps and other tools to help in our innovation efforts, to understand where RD&D is already happening, and to identify gaps and opportunities for new kinds of innovation.
•	Provide, on an annual basis, transparent, easily-accessible information on their respective clean energy RD&D efforts.
Each Member independently determines the best use of its own clean energy research and development funding and defines its own path to reach the doubling goal according to its own priorities, policies, processes, and laws; as well as the extent to which it participates in any international collaborations.

To reach its objectives, MI has developed an Action Plan, setting out four goals:
•	A substantial boost in public-sector investment in clean energy RD&D at the national level of MI members.
•	Increased private sector engagement and investment in energy innovation, particularly in key Innovation Challenges.
•	Many new or strengthened voluntary cross-border networks and partnerships on energy innovation, greater engagement from innovators, and accelerated progress in addressing specific Innovation Challenges.
•	Greater awareness amongst MI members and the wider clean energy community of the transformational potential of energy innovation, the progress being made, and the remaining critical clean energy innovation gaps and opportunities.
The next phase of MI will build on successes and shift focus toward outcomes that will further accelerate the pace of innovation, and thereby facilitate countries’ clean energy transitions by advancing the solutions and technologies needed to support national goals.
MI will take a mission-oriented approach, identifying key innovation barriers and decarbonisation pathways in sectors where accelerated effort is most needed, and where commitments from governments and the private sector can send a strong signal to the market and innovators, thereby stimulating action, faster.
MI will build new public-private innovation alliances, called Missions, around ambitious and inspirational goals and backed by voluntary commitments that can lead to tipping points in the cost and scale of clean energy solutions.
MI members will also develop an enhanced Innovation Platform to strengthen the global clean energy innovation ecosystem and to accelerate collaboration and learning.

The Alliance advocates solutions for agricultural landscapes, under variable weather and climate, to maintain sustainable productivity of food, feed, fiber and energy, and ensure the integrity of our natural resource base.","Alliance partners have set forth four objectives to guide the Alliance:
● Inspire agricultural and forest sector leaders to become leaders in the broader discussion
of climate change, including adaptation and mitigation;
● Educate agricultural and forestry leaders on the potential impacts of climate change in
ways relevant to their daily lives;
● Equip leaders and producers with the tools and knowledge they need to make informed
decisions and manage new risks under changing conditions; and
● Mobilize thought leaders to advocate for needed changes in land use practices, research,
education and policy.","Among other activities the members of North American Climate Smart Agriculture Alliance will (i) review latest information on what science is telling us about changing climatic conditions and the impact they will have on agriculture and forestry industries; (ii) formulate and prioritize recommendations on adaptation needs, priorities and policies to reduce risk and enhance the resilience of agricultural operations; (iii) support and comprise farmer/forester leadership teams that will share and discuss real-world adaptation and resiliency strategies with their peers at national, regional and local forums; and (iv) be active participants in the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture and the UNFCCC's climate workflow.","NACSAA's Guiding Principles for the KJWA:
● As affirmed in the communique from the 8th Meeting of G20 Agricultural Chief Scientists (MACS), science-based decision making should be the foundation for the adoption of climate smart technologies and practices for sustainable agriculture and global food production.
● Production and production efficiency per unit of land must increase going forward to meet the food needs of the future while incurring no net environmental cost. 
● As reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, outcomes (rather than means) applicable to any scale of enterprise must be emphasized, without predetermining technologies, production type or design components.
● Adaptation strategies must be recognized to require system approaches  that utilize a combination of improved efficiency, substitution (e.g. new crop varieties and breeds), and redesign/system transformation to reflexively respond to continuous short- and long-term changes in climate’s impacts on cultivated and natural ecosystem conditions. 
● Peer reviewed academic, business and farmer climate smart agriculture research and knowledge sharing recommendations outside of the UNFCCC should be considered by the SBI and SBSTA and integrated into the final KJWA report.
● There is no silver bullet solution for enhancing the resilience of agriculture: KJWA must embrace a systems approach that recognizes the tremendous diversity of agricultural landscapes and ecosystems and enables producers to utilize the systems and practices that best support their farming operations.
● Farmers must be at the center of all discussions and decision-making; significant input will be needed from a wide range of agricultural stakeholders, including technical agricultural experts drawn from farmer organizations, academia, industry, and international and regional organizations, especially those outside of the UNFCCC structure. 
● Context-specific priorities and solutions must be aligned with national policies and priorities, be determined based on the social, economic, and environmental conditions at site (including the diversity in type and scale of agricultural activity), and be subject to evaluation of potential synergies, tradeoffs, and net benefits.

Our purpose is to build resilience in the regions and communities most vulnerable to ocean risk, by pioneering finance and insurance products that incentivise investment in nature-based solutions. Our aim is to drive $500 million of investment into nature-based solutions by 2030, and surface at least 15 novel finance products by 2025 that incentivise private and blended finance into coastal natural capital.","To date, efforts by the ocean community, philanthropies, governments and the private sector to invest in ocean natural capital as a way of building resilience to change, empowering economically marginal and vulnerable communities and preparing these groups for adaptation, have been disparate, sparse and significantly underfunded. ORRAA is designed to tackle these challenges to achieve its ultimate outcome:
•	Improved state of coastal resilience for vulnerable populations, particularly women and girls in SIDS and coastal developing countries where ORRAA finance products/projects have been deployed. 
Over the next year, the Intermediate Outcomes identified in the logic model are designed to realise the objectives of the Alliance's work:
•	Deliver an increased pipeline of pilot projects for innovative finance products that increase coastal resilience,
•	Grow the effectiveness of the Alliance to influence greater investments in coastal natural capital, and, 
•	Improve the design/implementation of gender-sensitive ocean resilience pilot projects in key vulnerable regions","ORRAA will support coastal and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in ODA-eligible countries  that are directly threatened by the impacts of climate change by piloting and scaling innovative finance projects that will leverage greater private investment in coastal resilience. It is focused on:
1.	Building a multi-sector collaboration between governments, financial institutions, the insurance industry, environmental organizations and stakeholders from the Global South to pioneer ground-breaking finance products and projects that will help mitigate harm from ocean risk, and increase the adaptive capacity and resilience of coastal communities. 
2.	Establishing a Secretariat  to build the Alliance, coordinate its activities and outputs and deliver on its goals.
3.	Invest in core initial research needs and example projects that underpin the development of initial product offerings to unlock and incentivise greater private and blended finance investment into coastal natural capital (in situ conservation) to reduce the vulnerability of human and natural systems to the impacts of climate change.
Outcomes will be achieved through activities, outputs and immediate outcomes focused on delivering on the three pillars underpinning ORRAAs work:
1.	Practice & Innovation: building risk-adjusted, innovative and scalable products that change the risk perceptions of investing in coastal natural capital and increase resilience while delivering a return on investment 
2.	Research & Knowledge: accelerating research and using data to better understand, analyse, predict, model and manage ocean risk to drive future action and investments
3.	Policy & Influence: informing & advancing ocean and coastal resilience policy, governance, private sector and public understanding. 
The Alliance will engage three priority sectors, each of which is targeted through the intermediate and immediate outcomes:
1)	Vulnerable communities - to increase the adoption of practices and financial instruments that increase coastal resilience; 
2)	Private and public sector investors - to increase private/public investment into scalable, gender-sensitive ocean resilience pilot projects focused on key vulnerable regions; and

It aims to accelerate action towards a net zero emissions future consistent with the Paris Agreement. OGCI members are Aramco, bp, Chevron, CNPC, Eni, Equinor, ExxonMobil, Occidental, Petrobras, Repsol, Shell and TotalEnergies. Together, OGCI member companies represent about 30% of global oil and gas production. OGCI members set up OGCI Climate Investments to create a US$1 billion-plus fund that invests in companies, technologies and projects that accelerate decarbonization within energy, industry, built environments and transportation.

OGCI supports the goals of the Paris Agreement, limiting global warming to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C, and recognizes that there is a real urgency to act.
We support the need for the world to move to a net zero carbon emission future, also called carbon neutrality. This will require international collaboration and an energy transition and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas.
OGCI and its members companies, by taking individual and collective actions, will help accelerate the energy transition through deep reductions in greenhouse gases.
All OGCI member companies aim to reach net zero emissions from operations under their control1, and also leverage their influence to achieve the same in non-operated assets, within the timeframe set by the Paris agreement, recognizing that we have many, but still not all, the answers needed to get there.
We will continue to stay action-oriented, continue to report transparently, and update our ambitions as we progress towards net zero. Our updated set of ambitions include reducing upstream methane emissions intensity to well below 0.20% by 2025, bringing carbon intensity from our upstream operations down to 17.0 kg CO2e per barrel of oil equivalent by 2025 and bringing routine flaring to zero2 by 2030. These are important near-term steps on this journey. By 2025, this could bring an additional reduction of around 50 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year.
Our success will rely on acceleration of innovative and large-scale solutions such as applications of efficiency measures, sharing of best practices, electrification, hydrogen solutions, and carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS), methane leak detection and elimination, bioenergy as well as responsible investments in natural climate solutions (NCS).
In addition to collaborating and investing together with industry, it is essential for governments to develop enabling policies and regulations to provide certainty for long-term, large-scale profitable investments needed to reduce emissions. We encourage the implementation of explicit mechanisms giving a value to carbon, such as explicit or implicit carbon prices or incentives.",,,,Technical dialogue,Knowledge dissemination and exchange,,,,,,"Our updated set of ambitions include reducing upstream methane emissions intensity to well below 0.20% by 2025, bringing carbon intensity from our upstream operations down to 17.0 kg CO2e per barrel of oil equivalent by 2025 and bringing routine flaring to zero by 2030.

Founded in 2013, the initiative was developed in partnership with leading NGOs as well as with progressive palm oil producers.
POIG was established as a forum for actors along the supply chain to work together and create solutions to major challenges facing the palm oil sector and existing certification systems, including the RSPO. POIG aims to support the RSPO through building on RSPO standards and commitments and by both demonstrating innovation to implement RSPO existing standards as well as with additional critical issues. With a focus on the three thematic areas of environmental responsibility, partnerships with communities including workers’ rights, and corporate and product integrity, POIG members will strengthen their commitments to socially and environmentally responsible palm oil production.","POIG focuses on leveraging its experience to create innovations in the palm oil industry and acting as an advocate for these innovations. POIG aims to demonstrate that by setting and implementing ambitious standards, the industry can in particular break the link between palm oil production and the destruction of forests and peatlands, the exploitation of communities and workers, and climate change.
POIG is based around a set of formal requirements known as the ‘POIG Charter’. It is fundamental to the integrity, credibility and continued evolution of POIG that all members support, promote and work towards the implementation and promotion of the POIG Charter and its objectives and purposes. 
The objectives of the POIG Charter are:
1. to promote and support innovation and improvements in oil palm plantation and extraction mill management and throughout the supply chain on a range of environmental, social, supply chain and governance issues, and seek to have the innovations rolled out across the palm oil industry and reflected in the RSPO standard;
2. create added value for innovative and progressive producers and supply chain partners through increased market recognition and demand for palm oil products from innovative and improved practices; 
3. act as a forum for open discussions and sharing of experience with innovations and improvements in: oil palm plantation practices, extraction mill management practices, responsible procurement, and product traceability and verification throughout the supply chain; 
4. act as a forum to collectively engage with governments towards achieving recognition and support for innovations, and have them included in regulations and law.","POIG's main activities include:
1. Supporting existing verification/certification frameworks, such as the RSPO, by building on the RSPO standards and commitments. This includes the development, maintenance and sharing of a credible and verifiable benchmark (the POIG Charters and Verification Indicators), which addresses additional critical issues in relation to: no deforestation, no expansion and best management practices on peatlands, and the elimination of labour and human rights violations. POIG’s goal is not to act as a competing certification system to the RSPO, but to advocate for the RSPO and other organisations to integrate the improved practices outlined in the POIG Charters and Verification Indicators into existing standards and verification frameworks. 
2. Creating innovations in the palm oil industry and promoting these innovations and those of POIG's members. POIG acts as an innovation space for front-runners within the RSPO’s membership to make improvements in palm oil production practices including, for example, on labour issues facing the industry. POIG is also committed to the exploration and promotion of creative innovations on key issues, such as alternatives to drainage based use of peatlands and  mechanisms to strengthen the objectivity and integrity of audits.",Innovations successfully carried out by POIG's members can be viewed at: http://poig.org/further-resources/poig-innovations/,"Technical dialogue,  Political dialogue","Knowledge production and innovation,  Norms and standard setting,  Knowledge dissemination and exchange",,"POIG's mission is to achieve the adoption of responsible palm oil production practices by key players in the supply chain through developing and sharing a credible and verifiable benchmark, and creating and promoting innovations.

POIG has also developed a Charter for Retailers & Manufacturers (released in November 2015) and a Charter for Traders & Processors (released in November 2017). Members to which these Charters apply, are currently working towards progressing the implementation of these requirements. 
POIG has released an innovations publication in 2016, highlighting the labour rights innovations of its producer members. This includes the innovative work that was carried out by POIG members Musim Mas Group and Verite in developing and testing a Social Compliance Assessment. The report for the Social Compliance Assessment conducted for Musim Mas’ Indonesian Palm Oil Operations, was released in 2017.","Members to whom the Charters apply are required to work towards implementation and verification of compliance, as well as public reporting of progress. Implementation and public reporting progress is currently applicable to all producers, retailers and manufacturers, and traders and processors who are members of POIG. Annual verification of compliance with the POIG Charter and indicators is currently applicable to POIG's producer members.
Producer member compliance towards the POIG verification indicators is carried out through annual assessments by independent third-party verification bodies. The results of these verification assessments are reviewed by POIG and once approved, made available on the POIG website. 
Progress of POIG's Retailer and Manufacturer members towards the implementation of the Retailers & Manufacturers Charter is also communicated and reviewed through progress reporting.   
The Traders & Processors Charter has only been recently released (November 2017), and therefore, monitoring of progress on implementation by members will begin in 2018-2019. 
As a forum/platform for innovation, POIG also continuously facilitates spaces for dialogue among its members with regards to the innovative work they are engaging in, and to identify where POIG can support innovative projects.

The commitment depends on the nature of their business. (Unabated coal power generation refers to the use of coal without any technologies to substantially reduce its CO2 emissions, such as carbon capture and storage).
Large consumers of electricity commit to: Powering their operations without unabated coal-fired electricity. Recognizing that businesses must often connect to the grid in countries that still use coal, fulfilling this commitment can take the form of clean electricity contracts with utilities, Power Purchase Agreements that exclude coal, or the purchase of clean electricity certificates for a company’s operations. For example, commitments such as those made under the RE100 would enable a company to be a partner in the Alliance.
Electricity suppliers or generators commit to: Phasing out unabated coal-fired power stations from their asset base within a timeframe compatible with the Paris Agreement, and not building new unabated coal-fired power stations without operational carbon capture and storage.
Investors commit to: Restricting financing to existing unabated coal fired power stations to promote their phase-out within a timeframe compatible with the Paris Agreement, and restricting finance to new unabated coal fired power stations without operational carbon capture and storage.",,Political dialogue,Policy planning and recommendations,Policy planning and recommendations — Stakeholders endorsing a policyYear2019Value (#)80,Coal phase-out is needed no later than by 2030 in the OECD and EU28.,"The PPCA aims to:

As of 2020, R4 reached over 200,000 households (about 1 M people) in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Senegal, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Mozambique, Burkina Faso and Madagascar through a combination of four risk management strategies: improved resource management through asset creation (risk reduction); insurance (risk transfer); livelihoods diversification and microcredit (prudent risk taking); and savings (risk retention).",Africa,World Food Programme,International organisation,Italy,"The R4 Rural Resilience Initiative is the World Food Programme (WFP)’s flagship approach for integrated climate risk management. The initiative aims to help communities build resilience, incomes and wellbeing in the face of increasing climate variability and shocks.

Through R4, WFP has led the way in developing and testing innovative microinsurance solutions, which - when integrated with better access to financial services and nature-based solutions for risk reduction – help to diversify livelihoods, unlock investment potential, and provide vulnerable communities with an effective protection against different types and levels of shocks.

To support the sustainability and scale up of insurance solutions and risk management services, WFP gradually builds the capacity of local stakeholders in R4 countries, focusing on building systems and promoting increased national ownership, eventually contributing to strengthening the resilience of communities and governments, by supporting them to better prepare for and respond to climate and other shocks. 
The initiative aims to reach one million farming households insured in 22 countries by 2025.","""Through its innovative integrated climate risk management approach, R4 enables the poorest farmers to access crop insurance by participating in risk reduction activities. Assets built through such activities – including WFP’s Food Assistance for Assets programmes – promote the resilience of farmers and their families by steadily decreasing vulnerability to disaster risks over time.
When a shock hits, compensation for weather-related losses prevents farmers from having to take desperate measures such as selling productive assets, and stimulates faster recovery. By protecting farmers’ investments in case of a bad season, R4 enables them to invest in riskier but more remunerative enterprises, as well as in seeds, fertilizers and new technologies.
Evaluations show how R4 is helping improve farmers’ resilience. For example, in Ethiopia insured farmers save more than twice as much as those without any insurance, and they invest more in seeds, fertilizers and productive assets, such as plough oxen.
The initiative also has positive effects on gender equality. In Senegal, women claimed that they felt empowered as –  in addition to having increased access to land, seeds and water for irrigation and drinking – they could benefit from training in numeracy, literacy and business.

Four working Groups to support the delivery of REAP’s targets and advance specific thematic areas of work have been established, to address the following themes:
1. 3Ws of Early Action - mapping of existing early action initiatives to identify opportunities to scale up action
2. Marketplace - developing the REAP Marketplace to matching coordinated partner support to country needs on early warning-early action and facilitate sharing of solutions and experiences
3.Health - to develop and communicate best practice for early/anticipatory action in a COVID-19 context
4.Early Warning Initiatives - to build coherence between existing initiatives, share learning and co-produce greater action.",Global,Risk-informed Early Action Partnership (REAP),Other intergovernmental organization,Switzerland,"Launched at the UN Climate Action Summit (UNCAS) in September 2019, the Risk-informed Early Action Partnership (REAP) brings together an unprecedented range of stakeholders across the climate, humanitarian, and development communities with the aim of making 1 billion people safer from disaster by 2025.","The Partnership was launched with four ambitious targets which will drive a systemic shift towards acting earlier to reduce the impacts of disasters. The targets highlight the importance of national planning, financing and delivery mechanisms to support early action, as well as investment in warning systems that focus on reaching the most vulnerable, turning the ‘last mile’ into the ‘first mile’.
contributing to the achievement of the targets are suggested in this document. While the Partnership and its targets focus on climate-related hazards, ongoing responses to COVID- 19 highlight the interconnectedness of risks and how the need for early action and the benefits of the partnership are wider in scope.",,,,,,"REAP was launched with the announcement of four targets, each of which will contribute to making 1 Billion People Safer from disaster by 2025.","Achieving REAP’s targets will require a systemic shift in the way early warning and early action is implemented and planned for. Some of the potential outcomes from achieving REAP’s ambitious aims in different country contexts are illustrated below:
Integrated approaches based on multi-hazard early warning and predictable, coordinated funding allow government, communities and other actors to anticipate crises whilst also addressing long-term vulnerability.
Global and regional early warning tools are mobilised to address the capacity, data and knowledge gaps in conflict affected national
systems. Humanitarians and CSOs on the ground help combine this information into impact forecasts, while donors release funding in advance of hazard impacts.
National governments are supported to build coalitions across REAP partners and
stakeholders to co-design, fund and implement national programmes covering the full spectrum of climate and humanitarian interventions
Integrated risk management is supported by coordination between relevant actors, including regional hydrometeorological services, national meteorological offices, national disaster management agencies and provincial bodies.
National Governments are supported to create National Adaptation Plans and Disaster/Climate policies that allow for longer term preparedness and adaptation to current and future risks, which donors can support through investments.","Several drivers of change are needed to make 1 Billion People Safer from disasters. The drivers described below are not a mutually exclusive or exhaustive list, but rather represent some of the spaces and ways in which REAP expects to effect change.
a. Fostering global commitment on policy and practice
With its partners stretching across public and private, governmental and non-governmental actors, REAP is uniquely positioned to enable and facilitate the convening and coordinating required at a global level across a diverse range of actors. REAP will leverage its convening power to leverage more investment and commitment towards early action. The partnership will be a mechanism to bring together examples of what works and to encourage co-ordination and
complementarity between existing initiatives. By using its collective knowledge and influence, the Partnership will ensure that 1 billion people are made safer through larger, better organised and technically excellent interventions.
b. Enabling country level ownership of early action programmes
Under the leadership of national and local authorities of partner countries, REAP will promote, enable and facilitate interventions by partners that are designed to work within and in support of national systems and local capacities, with a fundamental focus on the needs of the most vulnerable. Partners will work to identify missing links in value chains for early warning-early action and to connect and strengthen existing initiatives where possible. 
c. Supporting match-making through a REAP Marketplace
Partners have requested the development of a Marketplace or ‘Partner Place’ to enable greater ambition on early warning-early action. A Working Group of interested REAP Partners has been formed to develop this enabling function of the Partnership that could match needs on early warning-early action against the offers of finance, technical assistance, knowledge and solutions that REAP partners can provide.",,,,,,No,No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, Yes, No, No, No, No, No

The available resources are organizational resources and donor funding.",Global,Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),United Nations or Specialised agency,Italy,"This is a unique partnership led by FAO, with over 500 companies and organizations from industry and civil society active in food loss and waste reduction. It aims to drive innovations, promote interdisciplinary dialogue and spark debates to generate solutions across the entire value chain, “from field to fork”. This initiative has recently developed a technical platform, that will be launched in the coming days, to measure and reduce food loss and waste. Altogether, this should allow a major reduction in agriculture emissions, as global food waste and loss account for 3.3Gt of CO2 equivalent per year.","Correcting the policy framework --> We call on the global community to meet its millennium goals. Eradicating hunger is among the top priorities here.
Optimizing agricultural practices --> We urgently advocate more sustainability, new methods for efficient crop cultivation and harvesting, and fighting losses through conservation of resources.
Shaping food production more sensibly --> We appeal to enterprises to steer demand and consumer behaviour better and to choose more sustainable production methods.
Promoting packaging and process technology --> We call for smart and sustainable production and packaging concepts to improve the supply of food to a growing global population.
Motivating retailers --> We see potentials for optimizing assortments, the supply chain, logistics and waste recycling in order to combat food losses.
Achieving a change in attitude --> We want to fight the widespread “throwaway” mindset and raise people’s awareness of and respect for food.","The SAVE FOOD Initiative has developed a methodology for these assessments, which emphasizes the importance of considering food loss solutions in the context of national climate change action plans and strategies.  The SAVE FOOD Initiative is also providing technical support to develop national post-harvest policies and subsector strategies. This provides an important opportunity to align food loss reduction measures with the NDCs and national climate strategies.
Moreover, a review of the INDCs from Sub-Saharan Africa shows that over half of them include direct or indirect links to food loss reductions such as post-harvest value chain improvements, mainly addressed as part of their adaptation priorities and technology needs. The SAVE FOOD Initiative is well-equipped to provide support to countries towards achieving the emission reduction pledges and adaptation priorities outlined in their NDCs on aspects that relate to FLW reduction, value chain efficiency and food systems in general.
Therefore, in response to the new Global Climate Action Agenda and whereas appropriate, FAO will support the mainstreaming of climate change in national food loss and waste reduction activities in member countries towards strengthening the NDC implementation and impact of reduction measures. Food loss reduction strategies and policies will be aligned with national climate change and sustainable development objectives and priorities with the aim of attracting international climate financing and mobilizing private sector investment for technology transfer and implementation.
Latest news from partners: http://www.fao.org/save-food/partners/partners-actions/en/","Fish smoking and drying are preservation techniques that are widely used in small-scale fisheries communities in developing coastal regions. Processing fish is also an important strategy to reduce losses by significantly increasing shelf-life of the product. This is advantageous compared to fresh or frozen fish which requires cold storage that is largely inaccessible due to electricity scarcity in rural areas. Fish smoking techniques in West and Central Africa are traditionally based on open kilns using mangrove wood as the main source of fuel. However, open kilns are highly energy inefficient, release contaminants and the dependence on mangrove fuel has been a significant driver of degradation of mangrove forests in the region. A new and easy-to-assemble fish smoking and drying technology pioneered by FAO has been developed to improve to energy efficiency in rural communities by using 50 percent less wood fuel compared to traditional open-type smoking rafts. The FAO-Thiaroye fish processing technology (FTT-Thiaroye) is also helping to reduce health hazards, improve food safety and quality, improve working conditions and cut down food losses in many small-scale fishing communities. The FTT consists of a dual functioning smoking oven and mechanical drier and is specifically designed to improve fuel-efficiency in small-scale fish smoking by encapsulating heat and smoke. Agricultural residues such as coconut husks, sugar-cane bagasse or manure can also be utilized as fuel in substitution for mangrove wood. Reducing the intensity of mangrove wood harvesting are expected to benefit the mangrove ecosystems and biodiversity through reduced deforestation and degradation of mangrove forests. This is also contributing to climate change mitigation as mangroves have some of the highest carbon sequestration potential of all terrestrial forest while building resilience to climate impacts through coastline protection. The FTT-Thairoye technology also does not release any contaminants such as carcinogens and tar directly onto the product, and is therefore in compliance with international food standards and other safety requirements while reducing quality losses during smoking. Additionally, processing operations can be conducted in any season thereby enabling drying activities during rainy and cloudy periods, which prevent losses otherwise due to insects, pests and spoilage from open air exposure. This protects businesses and commercial activities of small-scale fish operators from quality and market force losses. The technology has now been tested and adapted in 13 countries in Africa and Asia.","Implementation,  Funding","Technical operational implementation (ex-post),  Fundraising",,"The overall objective of the SAVE FOOD Initiative is to reduce global food loss and waste towards ensuring more productive, resilient and low-emission food systems. SAVE FOOD recognizes that food loss and waste reduction is cross-cutting in the context of climate action and offers a key pathway to cut emissions and boost resilience in food systems. Increasing food availability through food loss and waste reduction is crucial for ensuring food and nutrition security and will help to strengthen adaptation, risk reduction and resilience measures in vulnerable populations and regions. In addition, addressing the food loss and waste challenge through the deployment of climate technologies along the value chain presents an additional opportunity to enhance the mitigation potential in food systems and mobilize climate finance.
Quantitatively, FAO through the SAVE FOOD Initiative will provide assistance to its member countries towards delivering on SDG 12.3: “By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses”. 
SAVE FOOD is also supporting efforts to achieve regional objectives  such as:
Commitments made under the African Union Malabo Declaration to halve post-harvest losses in Africa by the year 2025. 
The Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) has included in the PLAN SAN CELAC halving the amount of per capita food and loss waste by 2030.
The qualitative and operational objectives are to enhance collaboration among partners and increase awareness in efforts to influence more sustainable production and consumption patterns. Stronger involvement from the private sector (farmers, industry) towards driving and investing in sustainable solutions is particularly one of the main objectives.
The work/roadmap of the SAVE FOOD Initiative is based on four pillars:
• Collaboration and coordination of world-wide initiatives on food loss and waste reduction 
• Awareness raising on the impacts and solutions for food loss and waste 
• Research on policy, strategy and programme development for food loss and waste reduction 
• Support to programmes and projects on food loss reduction strategies, implemented by private and public sectors
• A work plan is detailed in the SAVE FOOD Umbrella Programme.","The initiative responds to SDG Indicator 12.3.1:

In addition to providing clear criteria and a step-by-step process for all businesses, the SBTi provides tailored guidance for specific sectors such as power generation and finance. Targets submitted to SBTi undergo a process of review and validation to ensure that they are consistent with the level of decarbonization required to keep global temperature below thresholds defined by the Paris Agreement.
Through the SBTi’s Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign, hundreds of companies have also committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. In recognition that this long-term vision is only credible if supported by steep emissions reductions in the shorter term, these companies are committing to set science-based targets across their whole value chain.","SBTi has gathered evidence that companies that have set science-based targets are delivering emissions reductions in line with this ambition. The 338 companies in the analysis collectively reduced their annual emissions by 25% between 2015 and 2019 – a difference of 302 million tonnes, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of 78 coal-fired power plants.
This is true leadership and differs markedly from the global trend: over the same five-year period, global emissions from energy and industrial processes increased by around 3.4%. 
Furthermore, the typical SBTi company has reduced its scope 1 and 2 emissions at a linear rate of 6.4% a year since setting their targets, more than the 4.2% annual reduction the SBTi requires for targets aligned with 1.5°C.","Implementation,  Technical dialogue","Goal setting (ex-ante),  Knowledge dissemination and exchange,  Technical operational implementation (ex-post)","Technical operational implementation (ex-post) — Stakeholders who have committed to the goalsYear201520162017201820192020Value (#)471042284386041146

The Platform’s top priority is that existing activities and knowledge about what works be disseminated, replicated and funded so that results can be amplified in priority countries and sectors, at speed and scale.  There are many such examples of good practice, including:
Buildings - Mexico City: The Building Efficiency Accelerator has worked with over 100 stakeholder organizations, businesses and agencies in Mexico City to develop recommendations and an action plan to improve energy efficiency in buildings in the city. The two major implementation priorities are building energy codes and building energy retrofits. Mayor Mancera described this initiative and announced the 2016 actions at Buildings Day at COP 21 in Paris.
Revised regulations for building construction in Mexico City were proposed by the government in late 2015.  For the first time these regulations integrate the national building efficiency norms. In 2016 this proposal will go through legal review before final adoption. Trainings are also being organized for the officials in the cities delegations who are tasked with building approvals to ensure they have the expertise and capacity to implement the energy components of the new regulations. WRI/CTS EMBARQ and the Accelerator partners are core actors in moving these actions forward.     
CTS EMBARQ is working with the SEDEMA in Mexico City’s government to prioritize city government buildings for energy improvements, assess appropriate actions, then fund and implement retrofits. In 2016 3-5 buildings will be included in this process. The partners aim to have construction underway in one or more building by the end of the year. Simultaneously, the partners will be implementing a challenge campaign to encourage the federal government and private building owners to commit to improved energy management practices and retrofits in one or more of their buildings.
Vehicles - Kenya: The number of light duty vehicles (LDVs) in Kenya is increasing by 12% each year. It is expected that the number of light duty vehicles will reach at least 5 million vehicles by 2030 up from the 2 million vehicles registration in 2012. A vehicles inventory study for Kenya, supported by the Global Fuel Economy Initiative, showed that the fuel economy of vehicles imported into Kenya is getting worse: from an average of 7.4 L/100km (with a corresponding CO2 emission of 178 g/km) in 2010 to 7.7 L/100km (equivalent to a CO2 emission of 185 g/km) in 2012. This is equivalent to 717,000 tonnes of CO2 in 2012. 99% of registered vehicles were imported as second-hand or used vehicles. This calls for urgent policies to shift imports towards cleaner, more fuel efficient vehicles.
The Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Accelerator has been working with Kenya’s Energy Regulatory Commission to develop policies to improve vehicle fuel economy.  With the Energy Regulatory Commission, it supported an inventory study of imported vehicles carried out by the University of Nairobi to assess the trend in average fuel economy and CO2 emissions. This study built on an earlier one that was carried out by Climate XL for the period 2005 and 2008. The ERC formed a national multi-stakeholder team to implement the project. The findings of the study were presented to stakeholders in June 2014 and revised based on stakeholder reviews. A media launch was then carried out in April 2015 that saw the government committing to promoting imports of more fuel efficient vehicles. Subsequently, the government announced changes to the excise duty in the 2015 budget to encourage importation of newer vehicles with potential for lower emissions.  The expected benefits of the project are threefold: lower oil import bills for the government and oil consumption for consumers; improved urban air quality; and reduced greenhouse gases. 
The Accelerator is currently supporting Kenya to develop further strategies to encourage the importation of more fuel efficient vehicles including fiscal guidelines such as CO2-based taxation, consumer awareness schemes like mandatory vehicle labeling, and new vehicle purchase schemes. Draft proposals have been presented to the government in early 2016.  It is also providing advice and support about developing similar fuel economy policies to other governments in the East African region, including the need for harmonizing vehicle policies. As a result Uganda has recently concluded their vehicle inventory study, and the Accelerator is expanding its support for countries across Africa.","Technical dialogue,  Funding,  Implementation","Knowledge dissemination and exchange,  Fundraising,  Technical operational implementation (ex-post)",Fundraising — Funds raisedYear2018Value (MUS$)120,"Double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030
Double the rate of energy efficiency improvement in all the sub-sectors of the Platform - i.e. appliances, buildings, industry, lighting, vehicles fuel efficiency. SEforALL now aims at prioritizing its work in 20 countries (based on a energy efficiency heat map), identified as high-impact opportunity countries. Many individual Accelerator goals are interim in nature: each Accelerator has stated its own objectives towards meeting the overall goal of doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030 in each sector. In addition:
- Appliances: currently funded activities envisage CO2 equivalent emissions reductions of 10m tonnes p.a. and if total savings potential identified in 150 country assessments is achieved, it would result in avoidance of 1.25 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent per annum by 2030 (this includes savings from lighting as a product class).
- District energy: develop, retrofit or scale up district energy systems; 16 cities join the Accelerator with pilot cities in at least 5 countries committed to commission a demonstration project by 2018 to reduce heat/cool energy demand by 30% by 2020, equating to savings of 2.3 Mt CO2 equivalent.
- Industry: spread the implementation of Energy Management Systems with a target for half of industrial energy to be covered by EnMS.
- Lighting:  accelerate a global market transformation to environmentally sustainable, energy efficient lighting technologies, as well as to develop strategies to phase-out inefficient incandescent lamps to reduce CO2 emissions and the release of mercury from fossil fuel combustion (see comment on 'Appliances' above)
- Vehicle Fuel Efficiency: Doubling global vehicle fuel efficiency from 8 Lge/100km to 4Lge/100km by 2050, resulting in fuel savings of 3 billion barrels of oil a year by 2050 (cumulative savings of 54 billion barrels of oil in total by 2050); CO2 equiv. emissions reductions of >0.5 bn tonnes/year by 2025 and >1.5 bn tonnes/yr by 2050 (cumulative savings of 33 bn tonnes by 2050); Fuel bill savings of $400 bn/year in 2050, for a cumulative $8 trillion net saving by 2050; annual oil import bills  by >USD 300bn in 2025 and >USD 600bn in 2050 (based on oil price USD 100/bbl).",Combined resources of approximately $120m of direct and in-kind funding.,,,"Work is underway to better quantify the overall emissions impact of current and project work of all Accelerators and the Platform as a consolidated activity.

All states, provinces and regions are invited to disclose to CDP, including members of the Under2 Coalition and the States & Regions Alliance.
The Climate Group and CDP are united in their firm belief in the vital role that state and regional governments play in driving climate action and delivering sustainable economies that avoid dangerous climate change and lead to a net-zero emissions world. State and regional government’s climate action is fundamental to delivering the Paris Agreement and the disclosed data drives CDP’s analytical bench-marking, commitment tracking and data management; and The Climate Group’s governments networks, peer learning, policy work and promotion of climate leadership.","To showcase the level of ambition of states and regions globally, while at the same time taking stock of progress on climate mitigation.

Together these governments represent 20% of the global economy and 669 million citizens. Over 3800 individual climate actions were disclosed across 11 sectors to reduce emissions and aid the transition to a decarbonized society.
The Annual Disclosure 2019 update, calculates that 2020 targets set by state and regional governments are in line with the 1.5°C goal laid out in the Paris Agreement. However, longer term targets up to 2050 are not in line with a 1.5°C trajectory. 11 states and regions reported net-zero emissions targets but more governments must follow and increase their ambition. For further analysis, please refer to the Annual Disclosure report available at: TheClimateGroup.org/Annual-Disclosure.
Reporting states and regions have achieved an average of 14% reduction in emissions compared to their base years. Reporting states and regions are leaders in renewable energy: 7 states and regions are powered by 100% renewable electricity and 12 have 100% renewable energy or electricity targets.

1. Halve food loss and waste and consume conscientiously. 
- Food Loss & Waste: Sustainable Development Goal Target 12.3 calls for halving per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reducing food losses along production and supply chains (including postharvest losses) by 2030.
- Climate-Friendly Diets: By reducing overconsumption, making healthy and responsible choices in line with suggested dietary guidelines—while avoiding food waste—we can alleviate pressure on natural habitats and climate.
2. Sequester 1 gigaton of carbon each year in forests, soil and other natural and working lands by: 
- Keeping Carbon in the Ground: Agriculture and forestry businesses can shrink their carbon footprint through habitat conservation and by eliminating the loss and degradation and conversion of forests, grasslands, mangroves, soils and other habitats from their supply chains.
- Putting Carbon Back Into the Ground: We can increase the amount of carbon that is reabsorbed into the ground by reforesting lands and rehabilitating soils that have been cleared or degraded.
- Climate-Friendly Farming: By employing climate-smart production techniques, farmers and ranchers can yield food while building up more carbon in the ground.
3. Enable better consumption and production of food and fiber through finance, transparency, public-private collaboration and protecting local rights.
- Finance: Through innovative financing, lenders and investors can diffuse risk and provide more financial security so farmers, ranchers, and other producers can invest in improved production practices more confidently.
- Tech: From satellite monitoring to distributed ledgers like blockchain—new technologies can create more transparent supply chains and enable companies to verify their suppliers are producing responsibly.
- Coordination: Businesses should collaborate with each other and coordinate more closely with state and local governments to implement climate targets in their supply chains and drive strong policies that create a level playing field for producers.
- Protect Rights:The rights and safety of those on the front lines of habitat loss must be protected: Indigenous Peoples, conservationists on the ground, and local communities.",We need to unite a sector.

Develop management approaches, financial incentives and policy mechanisms for ensuring the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of coastal blue carbon ecosystems;
Engage local, national, and international governments in order to promote policies that support coastal blue carbon conservation, management and financing;
Develop comprehensive methods for assessing blue carbon stocks and emissions;
Implement projects around the world that demonstrate the feasibility of blue carbon accounting, management and incentive agreements; and
Support scientific research into the role of coastal blue carbon ecosystems for climate change mitigation.","To achieve these goals, the Blue Carbon Initiative has formed Science and Policy working groups. The International Blue Carbon Scientific Working Group identifies priority research areas, synthesizes current and emerging blue carbon research and provides the robust scientific basis for coastal carbon conservation, management and assessment. The International Blue Carbon Policy Working Group supports efforts to integrate blue carbon in existing international policy frameworks such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) among others.  Members of both working groups routinely collaborate to ensure that qualified science forms the basis of sound policy.
Each Working Group convenes several times a year.  At each Working Group meeting, the Initiative brings together international blue carbon science and policy experts to exchange knowledge and build local capacity.
The Blue Carbon Initiative partners, as well as many other organizations around the world, are working on conservation science, policy and management of blue carbon ecosystems globally. 
Projects are being developed at sites globally to protect and restore coastal ecosystems for their ""blue"" carbon value. Major objectives include national-level accounting of carbon stocks and emissions from blue carbon ecosystems, increased management effectiveness of blue carbon ecosystems within protected areas, and the development of blue carbon offsets for tourism activities.

Our target: support our partner cities in building resilient services and infrastructures and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in urban transport.","The objective of the TUMI is to accelerate the implementation of sustainable urban transport development and mitigation of climate change by mobilizing finance, building capacities and promoting innovative approaches.","Capacity building:
• Capacity building is core of our ENABLE pillar: ENABLE 3,000+ urban leaders, decision-makers, planners and students to plan and implement sustainable mobility concepts. We will support political leaders and change-makers in their professional environments by providing tailor-made capacity-building formats (cf. capacity development catalogue).

Regional networks, urban mobility labs, webinars and innovative approaches such as design thinking and peer-to-peer reviews are key elements. Together, we as TUMI-partners will strategically develop, strengthen and conduct capacity building programs for sustainable urban mobility.
Knowledge development:

TUMI can draw from the broad knowledge base of its partners with a wealth of publications, training offers and other materials as well as established access to key resource persons and professionals. These elements are used in various capacity building efforts and other formats to build knowledge among individuals and organizations.
Policy-making and implementation:

TUMI is only indirectly involved in policy making as it works through mechanisms such as capacity development, funding/financing and pilot measures. However, its partners aim at including lessons learnt and innovative approaches in policy dialogues and other formats. Further, it also supports the implementation of climate mitigation through policy based lending – thereby supporting policy making and implementation of national governments.",See  https://www.transformative-mobility.org/index.php?p=campaigns/2nd-global-urban-mobility-challenge,"Funding,  Capacity building,  Implementation","Fundraising,  Training and education,  Goal setting (ex-ante)","Training and education — Individual participating in the workshops or trainingsYear2021Value (#)3000

Developing and emerging country decision-makers have increased awareness of the benefits (economic, financial and climate) of adopting enabling polices to foster the transition to more energy-efficient products; and 150 country assessments are developed showing the savings and current policy status for each of the five products targeted under United for Efficiency.
3. Commitment is gained from relevant private sector partners and political leaders on energy efficiency of appliances, equipment, and lighting (to support implementation of this project and other projects on improving appliances and equipment efficiency)
4. National and regional stratagic market transfromation initiatives are supported/developed and implemented to transform markets for the deployment of energy-efficient appliances and products.
The current workplan is divided between the United for Efficiency Center of Excellence work, and the national and regional implementation of the policy framework across more than 40 countries.
The United for Efficiency Center of Excellence plans to engage with eight manufacturers supporting with in-kind co-financing: to engage with technical organisations to develop best practice policy recommendations; conduct 150 country assessments showing the savings potential (financial, greenhouse gas emissions, electricity) of energy-efficient products; conduct 150 country assessments showing the benefits of energy-efficient off-grid lighting; create step-by-step guides and tools available to countries; carry out in-person and remote training. 
In terms of national and regional policy framework implementation, the workplan is to continue working with 5 ongoing and 11 planned national Global Environment Facility projects receiving support from the United for Efficiency Center of Excellence; to support the regional harmonisation in three regions (West Africa, Southeast Asia, Central America); to support Climate Technology Centre and Network projects providing technical assistance in Dominican Republic, Jordan and Tunisia.","United for Efficiency uses an Integrated Policy Approach to accelerate adoption of energy-efficient lighting, appliances and equipment.

WBCSD Urban Infrastructure Initiative (UII),No,No,http://www.wbcsd.org/Projects/Sustainable-Cities/Resources/The-Urban-Infrastructure-Initiative-UII,,2010,2015,"WBCSD, Head Office, MAISON DE LA PAIX, Chemin Eugène-Rigot 2, Case Postale 246, CH-1211, Geneva 21, Tel: +41 (22) 839 3100, E-mail: info@wbcsd.org",,Global,WBSCD,Business,Switzerland,"The outcomes of the WBCSD Urban Infrastructure Initiative (UII) suggest that all cities seeking to realize their sustainability objectives can benefit from engaging with business early in the planning and strategy development process. Early engagement leverages the capability of business to identify innovative and cost-effective solutions to complex, cross-cutting urban sustainability challenges.
Cities are at the leading edge of the global sustainability agenda. By 2050, 70 % of the world’s population will live in cities and they are rising to this challenge by pursuing ambitious objectives that will make them more competitive, resource-efficient, resilient and inclusive.
Realizing these visions in practice is a complex challenge for city leaders. In particular, they will typically necessitate major transformations in the design, construction and operation of a city’s infrastructure systems – including buildings, energy, mobility, telecommunications, water, sanitation and waste management services – and optimizing the inter-linkages between these systems.
Businesses that are committed to sustainability and experienced in delivering effective solutions can help cities navigate these challenges and turn a high-level vision into practical and implementable action plans. Business can play a vital role not only in providing specific infrastructure, technology, services and financing solutions, but also in contributing to the strategy that will support the overall optimization of urban systems to drive sustainability.
While there are already excellent examples of cities and business working together at the strategic level, this is the exception rather than the rule.
The WBCSD established the UII to advance the urban sustainability agenda by showcasing the critical role that business can play as solutions providers and by providing a platform for collaborative strategic engagement between cities and business. The UII brings together 14 leading member companies – Cemex (Co-Chair), GDF SUEZ (Co-Chair) Siemens (Co-Chair), ACCIONA, AECOM, AGC, EDF, Honda, Nissan, Philips, Schneider Electric, TNT Express, Toyota and United Technologies – with an array of knowledge and skills to help unlock opportunities for urban authorities to create cities that are more sustainable, efficient and livable.
This multi-sector, multi-company group worked with the following leading cities: Turku (Finland); Tilburg (The Netherlands); Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Surat and Vadodara in Gujarat State (India) ; Yixing (China) ; Kobe (Japan) ; Guadalajara (Mexico) ; and Philadelphia (USA). In each city, the UII mobilized a multi-disciplinary team of company experts to work collaboratively with senior city officials. These teams took an integrated, cross-sector approach to analyzing the city’s major sustainability challenges and to developing an innovative “solutions landscape” (i.e., a portfolio of practical solutions) to address these challenges.
This final report summarizes the work done in these cities and highlights the lessons learned and potential applications where the early collaborative engagement with business should be considered by cities. It makes a number of recommendations for cities, businesses and other key stakeholders to take this critical agenda forward. The WBCSD believes that the example of the UII and these recommendations can provide clarity and guidance on how cities and business can make early collaborative dialogue happen in practice to produce real benefits.","A world where cities provide a sustainable environment for people to live, work, move and play.",,,"Implementation,  Technical dialogue","Technical operational implementation (ex-post),  Knowledge production and innovation",,,,,,,,"Final report for the initiative: https://docs.wbcsd.org/2014/04/UII_FinalReport.pdf

During oil production, associated gas is produced from the reservoir together with the oil. Much of this gas is utilized or conserved because governments and oil companies have made substantial investments to capture it; nevertheless, some of it is wastefully flared because of technical, regulatory, or economic constraints. As a result, thousands of gas flares at oil production sites around the globe burn approximately 140 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually, causing more than 300 million tons of CO2 to be emitted to the atmosphere. Gas flaring contributes to climate change and impacts the environment through emission of black carbon and other pollutants. It also wastes a valuable energy resource that could be used to advance the sustainable development of producing countries. For example, if the amount of gas that is flared annually were used for power generation, it could provide about 750 billion kWh of electricity, or more than the African continent’s current annual electricity consumption.",Governments and oil companies that endorse the Initiative commit to (a) not routinely flare gas in new oil field developments and (b) to end routine flaring in existing (legacy) fields as soon as possible and no later than 2030.,"The Initiative aims to stimulate the right environment of cooperation between all stakeholders so that economic solutions are found through appropriate regulation, application of technologies, and financial arrangements.
