# UN Climate Initiatives Platform

Simple python-based crawler for pulling data off the UN's [Climate Initiatives Platform](https://climateinitiativesplatform.org/index.php/Welcome).

Consult the excellent [Orchestrating Global Climate Governance Through Data: The UNFCCC Secretariat and the Global Climate Action Platform](https://direct.mit.edu/glep/article/22/4/151/111237/Orchestrating-Global-Climate-Governance-Through) by Mai and Els√§sser for a detailed discussion on the role of this data platform, and how it relates to the historic [UN NAZCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Climate_Action_(portal)) initiative and current [GCAP](https://climateaction.unfccc.int) data sources.
